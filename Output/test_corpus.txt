hales: this is so critical. i've talked to so many parents going door to door campaigning for this office who really want to maintain support for public schools in portland. but there's quite a bit of fatigue among those parents who have had to have auction after auction to keep the arts program in their neighborhood school. we have been holding education together with duct tape and bake sales in this city. that's commendable for those activists, but fatiguing as well. we have to put education on firm footing. arts and culture have to be part of that basic understanding of what school will provide for kids. so that's why i keep coming back to education. if our kids aren't artists by the time they graduate from high school, the odds they'll care about the arts and have the joy of experiencing it in their adult life is pretty low. i raised my kids with an appreciation for the arts. i'm proud of them. my daughter is a modern dancer, working in new york. my son is a stage manager at milagro, as i mentioned. that's important to me.

marge lived in a little flat connected to the lime grove hostel: one of west london's major drug wash-up shores. most addicts in the borough would end up being filtered through there at some point or other. and it wasn't a bad deal: free board and food and a cell check twice a day! it was packed to the tiles with mostly long term, mentally ill addicts who'd wash their smack down with tenants super and whatever downers or sleepers their stench had forced the local gp to prescribe them. marge wasn't in the hostel proper but had somehow managed to wrangle one of the permanent flats on its premises. that was kinda like everyone's dream in those days: to get one of the self-sufficient lime grove flats. they were the after-junk-life paradise offered up by the god of the hostel. the only catch was that to get one you had to be either sober or dying, and that's why for there only being five flats up for grabs the hostel was able to 'permanently' rehouse people a year. that its success was based on its rate of eviction no-one seemed to care about. housing and evicting fifty people were better statistics than housing only five. anyway, these little apartments sat just below, down where all the hostel residents could see and drool over them. there were no throw out times, no bars on the windows, no sign-in desk. it was freedom for the lucky few; a place to secretly kill yourself in peace. only for the lucky few who had ascended to hostel heaven it wasn't so much a paradise as an open hell: a den of addicts all cohabiting and thieving off each other. as everyone had once dreamt of getting out the hostel now they dreamt the same of this place. only this was permanent and there were only two ways out, and neither was a very attractive proposition. so it was a dream turned to shit, and this is where marge lived and where i knocked him up that bright autumn sunday afternoon.

think about it; this is a film directed lawrence kasdan and starring diane keaton, kevin kline, dianne wiest, richard jenkins and other pretty great actors. youôd think this would be a good movie, or at the very least a decent one, and instead we get this utterly forgettable and lifeless affair. ugh. it sucks because these actors are still very competent even with such crappy material, and ms. keaton and mr. kline do their best at bringing some life into beth and joseph, a married couple; sheôs super warm-hearted and yet is feeling really lonely because her husband, a back surgeon, is just this serious and uptight sort of repressed man.

however, the majority in society can be mobilized to defend our living standards in a direct way. the rich have stopped investing in society on a scale that is historic; our governments are looting our services and pay to make up the gambling debts of these same billionaires. we are on a trajectory toward leaving society as bare and sodden as dame street plaza is now.

it seems that even the chinese are susceptible to such petty rancour. i was shocked to read about a man from chongqing whose front door has been glued shut more than times by an anonymous fiend. had it happened only five or six times, one might have dismissed it as the prank of a practical joker, but gluing a door shut times clearly amounts to a vendetta. whoever is responsible must be motivated by boundless malice and a peculiar obsession about denying his victim free passage to and from his own property.
this is the first quilt that i finished. heather bailey really started my love for fabrics and quilting with her freshcut collection. it really was a big quilt to make for my first project, but it's one of those quilts that still gets used every fall. it seems to get softer and more comfortable with age! i remember trying to read online as much as i could about quilting and how to make a quilt. i found a video on youtube that showed you how to baste a quilt. i ended up basting this one with thread and rolling it up on a long board to keep everything straight. it's a bit different than how i do things today, but the quilt did turn out really nice and it was really easy to quilt it that way.

this would perhaps have been made slightly more pleasant if this one girl (whom i am having tuition with four times this week), would at least make the effort to revise a little before my arrival. the concepts that she has forgotten are simple ones that only require memory work. they hardly even require her to apply anything. it frustrates me so very greatly because i am merely her tutor. i cannot do the memory work for her. i can only tell her what she needs to commit to memory and then help her with the application, but if she doesnôt even bother to commit said things to memory, then my presence is rendered pointless.

it should come as no surprise that it's a night shade published title. putting aside its similarity to glen cook, one of night shade's most prolific authors, scourge of the betrayer screams 'new voice'. like last year's god's war (hurley), it isn't reinterpreting old genre conventions, but finding entirely new pathways. once again i find myself applauding night shade for its editorial vision, further cementing them as my go to source for something i've never seen before. i can't wait to read whatever's next for jeff salyards. his debut can't be considered anything but a tremendous success.
the browns second round pick mitchell schwartz will end up being just as important as trent richardson and brandon weeden. mitchell is a right tackle, and this this is a very important position on the browns offensive line. the left side of the line is pretty solid with pro bowl left tackle joe thomas anchoring that side. an offense can not run effectively with out the line giving the quarterback time to throw, and opening up holes for the running back.

pranab mukherjee, in his budget speech, said, to ensure that the objectives of the national food security bill are effectively realised, a public distribution system using the aadhar platform is being created.ù the finance minister also mentioned, the recommendations of the task force headed by nandan nilekani on it strategy for direct transfer of subsidy have been accepted.ù speaking to this newspaper, anupam saraf, a former governance advisor to the government of goa and an independent leadership, strategy and innovation mentor, said, the process of registering individuals under aadhar was assigned to third parties. there is no way to ensure that the third parties will not register non-existent individuals. this leaves a lot of room for massive scams, corruption and leakages if the data is used for distribution of subsidies. thus the proposed food security bill and targeting of fertilizer subsidies will be based on data which is not reliable. instead of better targeting of subsidies, it will only lead to more leakages.ù

Âútsukaôs world and variation,ù originally published in , is ostensibly about bikkuriman chocolates, or, more specifically, about the trading cards packaged with the chocolates. it was because of the trading cards that the chocolates were such a phenomenal hit with children around the time that Âútsuka was writing, even though the character bikkurimanù had no television or manga tie-in products. the secret to bikkurimanôs success was that, on the back of each trading card, there was a short paragraph of information about the character depicted on the front. if a child collected enough cards, he would gradually be able to piece together a larger story and gain a broader perspective on the bikkuriman universe.

ì no, i think icelanders have a strong tendency to lie in surveys ì and to use surveys to lie. an example of the former would be when we were asked if we were religious, and everyone said they believed in god. everyone knows icelanders are heathen dogs that believe in elves, ghosts, the supernatural and forces of nature. an example of the former came when aluminium champion said that over percent of women in the eastern fjords would work in a smelter. he òforgotô to mention that the actual question in the survey was, if an interesting position was offered, would you or would you not consider working at the alcoa fjar„∞a„°l plant?ù
i also never got the huge insights york had after profiling, because they were pretty damn obvious % of the time. although i have to wonder if that was intentional, too: if the game's meant to be uncanny in that david lynch way, it makes a weird sort of sense that york is only able to suss out these blatantly obvious things when the player (zach) figured them out ages ago. this obvious disconnect kept making me think that all this was taking place in york's mind; like, duh, it's ritualistic, did the bloody altar not tip you off? "fk in the coffee" is ridiculous not only because...well, it's ridiculous, but also because the second you meet kaysen, you've figured out he's somehow behind all this. again, uncanny.
these church dogs provided an allegorical display of various virtues of the christian faith: eyes fixed solely on jesus, a desire to seek godôs presence, vigilance in the face of worldly distractions, and finding refuge in god. dogs know their master and are completely devoted regardless of the circumstances. but it should be dogged devotion to god, not to dogma. more than the church buildings i have visited and the organized religion they represented, manôs best friend pointed the way back to faith. the word dog, after all, is god spelled backwards.

so to the strikers and this could be where they struggle in the premier league as they donôt have anyone that has consistently scored in the top flight. but they shouldnôt be worried as rickie lambert who has scored goals in games in the championship and is a similar player to grant holt who has done fantastically well for norwich city. alongside him they have billy sharp who is also a brilliant goal scorer and after a slightly slow start now has nine goals in games. but the big question is will they have enough ability to score the goals to keep the team in the league.

history shows that higher taxes are compatible with economic growth and job creation: job creation and gdp growth were significantly stronger following the clinton tax increases than following the bush tax cuts. further, the congressional budget office (cbo) concludes that letting the bush-era tax cuts expire on schedule would strengthen long-term economic growth, on balance, if policymakers used the revenue saved to reduce deficits. in other words, any negative impact on economic growth from increasing taxes on high-income people would be more than offset by the positive effects of using the resulting revenue gain to reduce the budget deficit. tax increases can also be used to fund, or to forestall cuts in, productive public investments in areas that support growth such as public education, basic research, and infrastructure.

some argue that the increasing the rate of innovation in the u.s. is counterproductive to manufacturing employment. if technology means that fewer workers can produce the same amount of goods, then, that progress will increase productivity. yet economic theory and evidence, contradict this argument. the evidence suggests just the opposite: that productivity growth has not led to job losses in manufacturing; instead it has led to job gains. economic theory states that even though a productivity increase means that fewer workers are needed to produce a given quantity of output, the productivity increase also allows product prices to be lower, increasing the size of the product market. the larger market means that firms will need to hire more workers. the additional hiring will offset the short-term job loss. therefore, the overall impact of an increase in productivity is usually to increase employment rather than reduce it.

:: the movie the rocketeer is an entertaining little adventure flick that i enjoyed back when it came out in the early s. however, i did not realize that it was based on a comic book, by a man named dave stevens. an omnibus edition collects the complete adventures of the rocketeer, which were apparently serialized in several publications before at last appearing in a one-shot issue that resolved a cliffhanger. unfortunately, that's all that exists of the rocketeer; stevens died of leukemia not long after finishing the rocketeer. i was pleased to note the degree to which the film honored the retro homage tone of the comic. there's a lot to be fond of here.

beifa appealed on various grounds and was successful. the company was correct to say that its request for proof of use of the earlier mark was wrongly refused, but this was not fatal since this ground was raised for the first time only before the general court. beifa had more luck when it came to a comparison of the design with the earlier mark: " ... it is apparent from the registration certificate for the earlier mark, which was in the case-file in the proceedings before ohim, that that mark is figurative, consisting in the image reproduced ... above. in the light of that aspect, all the parties agreed at the hearing that the only mark taken into consideration by the various adjudicating bodies within ohim, when considering the application for a declaration of invalidity, was the earlier mark, which is a figurative mark, a fact which was recorded in the minutes.

essentially, he points out that there is supposed to be an intrinsic unity between the word of god in the readings, the homily, and the consecration of the eucharist. having layperson give the homily, he argues, breaks that intrinsic unity. he doesn't say so (for obvious reasons), but his argument applies equally, i think, to the permitted option in the of (but not requirement) of the laity doing the first and second readings:
my birthday:
one lazy sunday afternoon, propped up by a generous array of pillows, i spent a lovely lazy hour lying on my bed. the soft tunes of madeleine peyroux fluttered in the background as i perused blogs and devoured recipes, while sipping from a never-ending mug of russian caravan tea. the sun was peeking through my gloriously large bedroom window, gently kissing the crown of my head and encouraging me to chill my tea with a few ice-blocks. i did not oblige, however. i've never been a fan of ice-tea.

again, i'm not certain that the characters are sketched in and performed with enough depth for its psychological/philosophical concerns to resonate beyond our awareness of their place in the script's allegorical scheme. but then comes the film's final five minutes, when manny and the warden finally have their date with destiny. as hellbent as he remains on not returning to prison, manny's own sense of humanity finally kicks in as he heroically uncouples the lead train carîproving to buck, who had failed at the task earlier, that the task could be done if he'd put his mind to itîand saves buck and sara from certain death while forging ahead with the fate he himself has decided upon.

magic is an interesting word. it is used frequently when one is making reference to the moon, lunar gods and goddesses, lunar power, or lunar ceremonies. magic is often a misunderstood word. on the level of the masses, magic is slight of hand. it is an illusion that is perpetrated upon others who cannot see beyond the illusion. they cannot imagine how the magician pulled the rabbit out of the hat! but this is not the kind of magic we are talking about. magic, in the spiritual sense, is an operation to bring about certain conditions and energies from the more subtle worlds or dimensions of time-space, and manifest them in the physical world. magic is also for the purpose of bringing about change in some way. of all the planetary bodies that the earth is related to, it is the moon that is the earthôs companion, that is the earthôs sister. when you look at the calendar you will see that the moon moves very quickly around the zodiacal wheel. it changes signs every two-to-two-and-a-half days. and so, in a . ì day period, the moon will have traversed the entire zodiac. even the sun takes - days to do this. the planet saturn takes two years. so, when you look at it from this perspective, the moon is an ever-changing body, which is why astrologers, for the last , years, have said that the moon rulesù change. it has been said that change is constant, the only constant in the universe.

i'm still just in utter and absolute shock and filled with joy that it's over. anticipating this surgery was torture. serious torture. i would lie awake and think about everything. i would remember her past surgeries and how tough they were then imagine this time around being so much harder. i'd worry about complications, i'd think of the worst case scenario. then i'd tell myself to stop, breathe, and say a prayer to stop my crazy mind. it was hard in the hospital and there's been hard moments since, and people ask how i'm doing it, and i just want to make them understand that it dosn't really matter how hard it is, the happiness to have it over and done with a great outcome makes any hard day or moment okay. i don't think even in my wildest hopes and dreams i would've thought we'd be here / years ago. she was just considered too weak to survive. everyone goes through hard things. everyone. i was just talking to a dear friend today that is going through something hard. completely different, but hard nonetheless.

the first thing we must do is look seriously at the warning. the writer of hebrews is saying that if this group of people (the people mentioned in -) fall away, it is impossible to renew them to repentance. their fate is sealed and they cannot be saved again. the writer of hebrews is not giving a, saved, then lost, then saved¶ù theology that is so popular with many arminians. to put it directly, if a christian can lose his salvation, then he can never gain it back.
nevertheless cardinal cookeôs call for volunteers to go out on the streets to fight pornography was met with an enthusiastic response. led by father duffel of sacred heart church and father rappelyea of holy cross with the strong backing of the mcmanus democratic club, groups of residents, largely the remnants of the old irish community with a few younger professionals from the newer buildings, would go out every night to demonstrate against pornography on the streets, and at times confront the pimps and prostitutes and their customers. in a sense, not since the days of the irish street gangs like the gophers had their been such a fight for control of the streets of hellôs kitchen and certainly this one had much higher stakesîwith the catholic church and groups like the mcmanus club on one side and the pimps, prostitutes, pornographers along with the colombo crime family on the other.
this is simpler, yet more effective than most expert-driven methods in international development.ù none of his solutions were suggested by outsiders, nor evaluated, nor funded as a concept on its own. funding goes into scholarships (the ultimate reward for individual performance) but the rest of the system is community and volunteer driven. it works because gichuki builds upon solid foundations ì by starting with the child, listening to the child, working with the school, orienting parents, and inviting community elders to participate in guiding the communityôs children.

now we have rosie, and now we have yet another style of training. so far, anyway--at least, in puppy kindergarten--the training has been all treat-training. we give treats for sit and treats for down and treats for wait and treats for this and treats for that, and we play the "drop it!" game in which we distract the pups from chewing on our socks and shoes and other contraband by scattering treats across the ground and merrily singing, "drop it!" and ostensibly they abandon the sock and scramble after the treats and eventually they will abandon the sock on the command, no treats necessary.

the path of religion although can bring some serenity and belief to ones lives will not take you that far down the spiritual path to perception,awareness, and enlightenment. religion contains too much dogma within and has been altered dramatically down the ages by the people who run it, and most of the scriptures of any religion can be interpreted to suit the ego. without question however religious symbology and artifacts can be used to help you along the spiritual path, the cross for instance can be used as a focal point to draw upon the power of the christ consciousness. any image of mary can create a peaceful blessing setting, a statue of buddha can bring calmness and oneness etc¶in fact although i am not a christian, i know i follow the ten commandments of god in my d bubble reality environment ..thatôs what they were designed for, making ours and other peopleôs lives better here on earth..they are not really much help when it come to travelling the spiritual path and wanting to understand our true meaning.

whatever oneôs stance on the merits of celebrity activism, one cannot ignore the fact that famous people such as george clooney, angelina jolie or uôs bono have made a valuable contribution to raising awareness of pressing issues, especially poverty reduction, debt relief, refugee assistance and human rights violations. of course with celebrity activism comes the risk of oversimplifying complex issues or encouraging emotional narratives that clash with the realities of policy formulation / implementation. however, one cannot deny that celebrity involvement in non-profit advocacy has lead to a demonstrably better mobilization of public opinion and a facilitated access to decision-makers compared with what the average activist/ngo could hope to achieve.

one may say that this only mirrored the dreadful crimes germany committed in poland, but i think that's a cop-out, because those who suffered weren't necessarily the guilty parties. neither the children who died in freezing cold railway carriages, or the little girl with the bleeding feet deserved what happened to them. nor, i think, had my crusty old great-grandfather from the mountains, who hated the nazis, and, having been deported at the age of ninety, died in a displaced persons' camp in the new east germany, refusing all my grandfather's attempts to bring him to the west, because he couldn't believe he'd never see his home again.
naturally, that person's responsibility is just like a mother that suddenly decided to breastfeed her one and only newborn baby in the middle of a battlefield overrun by nazis during world war ii. it's that bad.

it has been about a year now since a kindle first arrived on my doorstep, and a glance at the contents of my little electronic friend will quickly tell you what i have become accustomed to using it for. the majority of the digital books i have stored away for a rainy day are german-language classics, books i'm not quite sure of but would like to give a go, and it is for this availability of free classic texts that i am extremely grateful. while blindly perusing teutonic novellas doesn't always work out for the best (e.g. die gl„ºcksritter, die judenbuche), more often than not (e.g. theodor storm, theodor fontane, lena christ) i've come up with some new favourite writers.

those types of patient expectations are pretty standard and if there are any issues are resolved without much fanfare. the expectation that i find the hardest to come to terms with is when a patient has had a previous physical therapy experience at a different clinic (usually a good one) and expects me to provide the same type of treatment as before. sometimes they come to me and say i want the heat and the electrical things.ù and thatôs it. or they come in and ask do you do massage?ù well technically yes but probably not like they are expecting. or my last therapist didnôt make me exercise, why should i now?ù nine times out of ten they are asking sincerely and without malice. they were treated a certain way and benefited from it and now expect the same from me. this is where it can get a little sticky for me. if what they are expecting is in line with what i think they need to get better i will do it. however, if what they are asking for is just a band-aid or does not mesh with my treatment plan and overall physical therapy philosophy i will be more hesitant to do what they are asking for. at this point it is up to me to convey my thought process to the patient in a concise, understandable, and professional way. if i do this the vast majority of patients have no problem with my decision and are thank me for being up front with them. every once in a while i have a patient who isnôt satisfied with my explanation and half heartedly continues therapy or quits all together. and this is the tough lesson i have had to learn over the years. you canôt please everybody.

you can buy precut cards that measure -/ inches by -/ inches at art and hobby stores. i found canvas and wood ones at hobby lobby. some paper manufacturers have designed paper with rectangles the size needed for atcs. the paper in the photo is pink paislee butterfly garden which is available in the flying unicorn store. you would have to atcs to cut out of this page. tim holtz also has x paper with some of the pattern
at school, i learned about the ancient civilisations of egypt, india, rome and greece, but sub-saharan africa wasnôt mentioned. and so outside of school, i became more fervent in my curiosity: learning about colonialism, slavery in america, apartheid, nelson mandela, archbishop desmond tutu from my mother, the media, literature and the internet. i read uncle tomôs cabin, long walk to freedom, anything i could get my hands on and news articles about african countries were always the first to get my interest.

now there are aspects of the film i did quite enjoy. the look and fashion sense of the film, caught somewhere between the denizens of emerald city and the post-millennial club kids of the nyc dance scene (seriously, why doesn't lady gag have a cameo here), are rather alluring, but even that only went so far and stopped. the main problem with the film though, is the film's idea of satire. attempting, one assumes, at creating a time and place where one can criticize the ideas of reality tv and modern society's desensitized outlook on violence, ross's film ends up playing to this targeted demographic instead of taking aim at them. but then, perhaps this is just me reading too much into the probabilities and possibilities of such a story that has ingrained essences of lord of the flies and a brave new world (and let's not forget the film battle royale which already did this near-exact scenario more than a decade ago - and did it better) hidden behind lines and scenes that never play out as the demented social commentary they should. in other words we are meant to revel in kids killing kids and go rah rah rah all the way home, without ever getting anything else out of it.

i have pretty much set up the plot already, but a probe is flying through space, constantly blaring out a whale song message while disabling ay ship it comes across. when it reaches earth and gets no answer from whales, it blots out the sun and begins boiling the oceans. i hate it when call and no oneôs home, too, but geez, i do not burn their house down in anger. the probeôs actions are necessary to have a conflict in the movie, but think about the message it sends; it does not matter if we preserve endangered species, because at some point, an alien probe is going to come destroy the environment anyway.

our household already has a useful stash of shopping bags, and are in the routine of using them, but i realized we could do with some reusable produce bags. although we re-use them a lot of the time, i found that we were always coming home with a few more plastic produce bags every time we bought our fruit and veg. inspired by some handmade mesh produce bags i saw on flickr, and this tutorial from wisdom of the moon, i hit our local second hand shops and found a sheer mesh curtain to re-purpose. one evening with my overlocker (aka serger) later i had a set of mesh bags.

the list of players found in this set is really mind boggling. from ewing, robinson and olajuwon to barkley, stockton and rodman, this set has just about everyone in it. unfortunately, two glaring omissions are that of larry bird and magic johnson. i know neither played during the ' nba season, but they are in the tsc base set. otherwise, a checklist for an early 's set doesn't get much better than this.
for craft brewers, it may pay to keep their options open. new belgium downplayed the risks in a online response to a customer's question: "we became aware of bpa in epoxy resin can liners during our due diligence prior to deciding on packaging in cans. we looked into the matter thoroughly. what became apparent is that there are no cans whose lining does not contain bpa. the industry is actively looking for alternatives, but as yet, none exist. we still believe the benefits of cans outweigh the potential risk of the liners because the anxiety surrounding bpa seems to have far outstripped the science."

researchers at penn state university have followed up their initial report, that again is being widely reported in the media (i heard about it first via national public radio.) it seems that the interaction between the ants and their parasitic fungal species is far more complicated than proposed earlier, and this new study models the spread of the fungus within the population of ants in a colony, as opposed to between individuals.

death masks were also believed to help the deceased soul to pass more easily into the next life. the respect and sacredness of the funeral rites of mask dancing was also believed to protect from reprisals from the dead and prevent the risk of wandering spirits. in some tribes the death mask was used in initiatory or homage ceremonies, which recounted the creation story and the appearance of death among human beings.
even so the landscape is stirring, like the one in the deccan plateau, with fields stretching a long way off, a succession of neatly cut rows of livelihood, nuanced by the crops sown and harvested, enlivened by the stark contrast of farmers dwarfed by the land they till, slight figures embraced by a landscape largely emptied of human presence, spotted only because they break with the uniformity of the land that dutifully conforms to the character the farmers lent it and one they strive to retain in the harshest of times.

the allure of black leather is so strong in cruising, that even karen allen is briefly tempted by its creaking appeal (much like det. bayliss was drawn to leather in the homicide: life on the street episode titled "a many splendored thing"). capturing the sleazy charm of the leather bar scene in late 's new york city (the club scenes ooze authenticity), william friedkin has made a compelling document of a period of time that will never be repeated. sure, people still wear leather and have anal sex, but i bet they don't do it with as much gusto. no, this film is a must for anyone who loves leather, old school al pacino (you know, before he became foghorn leghorn), jock straps (especially when they're worn in a non-athletic environment), extras who nearly trip while climbing up stairs, awkward nightclub dancing, and, of course, denim vests.

things senator obama has said that aren't exactly correct.
i think that there is now a very grave crisis of religious life, and that one should not speak of renewal, but rather of decadence. i think that this crisis is hitting the atlantic area above all. eastern europe and the countries of africa and asia present in this regard a better state of spiritual health. this crisis is manifesting itself in all areas. the evangelical counsels are no longer considered as consecrations to god, but are seen in a sociological and psychological perspective. we are concerned about not presenting a bourgeois facade, but on the individual level poverty is not practiced. the group dynamic replaces religious obedience; with the pretext of reacting against formalism, all regularity of the life of prayer is abandoned and the first consequence of this state of confusion is the disappearance of vocations, because young people require a serious formation. and moreover there are the numerous and scandalous desertions of religious who renege on the pact that bound them to the christian people.

they piled the sheets up in a well-ordered stack, and the professor clamped them securely together. the whole they covered with a box or sort of cover constructed of pure fused quartz, so well fused and treated that it was practically clear of all flaws or blemishes. jerry straightened up, cast about with his laughing blue eyes, and finally went over to where a rather large machine stood mounted on a set of wheels, much like the carriage of a movable x-ray apparatus. the machine itself resembled a violet ray machine with a large bulb of cherry-red clear glass superimposed upon its top. this bulb seemed to have five electric connections shaped much like the anode reflector in an x-ray machine. in fact, the five-fingered affair looked as though it might be a freak roentgen ray generator, the excess anodes giving higher power, perhaps. the blunt ends of the anti-cathodes were exceptionally peculiar in this large tube -- there seemed to be no end! there was no hole, or was there a visible surface. that the anode rod was solid could be proved by feeling the end, but all attempts to see any surface resulted in a sort of confusing impression of void space.

after reading these news reports, i quickly understood that brooks had not acted alone. in fact, it was a narrow-minded society that provided ammunition for this crime. it was only the gay community that stood strong and honestly told the truth about these murders. they loudly proclaimed that this double homicide was not a neighborhood feud but a hate crime. as a continued tribute to the gay community, i am honored at marianne k. martinôs request to write the forward of her latest novel, the indelible heart. this novel extends some of the plot threads related to my mother and christine that appeared in martinôs first novel love in balance and succeeds in giving a personal face to the events surrounding the murders. though it is a work of fiction, the narrative highlights how in fact, the gay community rallied together to fight homophobia and violence in response to this shocking crime. i encourage people to read this profoundly moving novel and realize that it is our duty as members of society to stand together and continue a united struggle against intolerance and violence.
my thought is that baby c is overtired, too, since he hasn't made up for the sleep he is losing at night. so i am dedicated to getting him to take a nap this afternoon. he took a typically short one this morning but it is clearly not enough. the book said that it can take as long as an hour the first time that you try to get them to self-soothe by checking on them every minutes or so. i am willing to try that.
my friends and i listened to all the popular rockers. my first concerts included aerosmith and the stones. we all had our favorite party music and later, our favorite cruising music, enjoyed on tape by the lucky few with an eight-track or cassette deck in their car.

then about half way through the run, something odd happened. i began to feel my breathing become more labored and then my throat felt like it was tightening up or closing. it really freaked me out! i stopped for a second and waved at suzanne who was closest to me and croaked out a wait!ù i put my hands above my head and took a few deep breaths and my throat eventually settled back to normal. we walked a little then got back into the run only to have my throat do the same thing after a few minutes. so we walked again and caught up to paige. we began running again and again my throat began closing up.
lately, though, my three year old has been all arms and elbows and knees and restlessness and wriggling and discomfort. rocking, at times, has become something of a chore. she is getting big. it is hard to hold her on my lap as comfortably. i have wondered to myself, reluctantly, if it is time to give up this, our favorite ritual.

whether they are cognizant of it or not, those who permit and encourage mass immigration into britain are pursuing a huge, unplanned exercise in nation building. britainôs own failures in this area ì iraq in the s, palestine, the partition of india, the unnatural and brutal division of ireland and the meltdown in iraq post- ì have been so disastrous that one would have thought they would have compelled politicians to reject any such plans for britain. where there are racial and cultural differences nation building can only be achieved through violence and any such artificially constructed nation will eventually be destroyed in violence. nations may be seen as a contract which individuals make with their fellows. where there are too many othersù there can be no contract, then government, often by the application of harsh legislation, must step in to regulate the disputes and allocate resources which should properly be left to individuals making their own decisions. the persecution of whites in the usa in the name of affirmative action and equal opportunities is an example. swedes have been traditionally willing to tolerate levels of high taxation in order to support the welfare state because their country has always been racially homogenous. once racial minorities in sweden become too big and too troublesome, support for high taxation will break down or swedes like their fellow europeans will suffer and complain in silence. racial and cultural differences matter.

drew's a bit of a loner. she has a pet rat, her dead dad's book of lists, an encyclopedic knowledge of cheese from working at her mom's cheese shop, and a crush on nick, the surf bum who works behind the counter. it's the summer before eighth grade and drew's days seem like business as usual, until one night after closing time, when she meets a strange boy in the alley named emmett crane. who he is, why he's there, where the cut on his cheek came from, and his bottomless knowledge of rats are all mysteries drew will untangle as they are drawn closer together, and drew enters into the first true friendship, and adventure, of her life.what i liked about this story was the way it transported me to summer time as a year old. it made me reminisce about bike rides around the neighborhood, with the sun shining on my face, trips to the local public pool and to the park...the feeling of freedom and innocence all rolled into this one book.

ssf and sperm competition are complementary, so that for the multiple males engaging in sexual intercourse with the female, their bodies produce genetically superior and more fertile sperm, to compete with the sperm of the other males, as well as greater quantities of it, increasing the likelihood of impregnation. it is almost as if the testicles know that the ssf has been or will be activated and therefore makes the best sperm it can so that the ssf ends up picking its sperm over that of other men.

over time, discovered authors - but in particular bookforce - has got things badly wrong. it should not be forgotten that the company has also got a lot right. running any business that combines various forms of publishing options is a tough one to pull off; few companies are deft and equipped enough to run a print and distribution service, as well as operate and market four publishing imprints. you will recall earlier in this review i cited a newsletter from former bookforce client, kima global. it was interesting to discover kima global switched to lightning sourceôs print and fulfilment services. what it does reveal is the level bookforce were trying to aspire toîreal dream stuff. i admire the ambition, but reality can deliver some powerful kicks to your nuts.

many people both in britain and around the world are beginning to wake up to this reality and have begun to fightback in various ways, be it the recent student demonstrations and university occupations in britain, the mass demonstrations and revolutions in north africa and the middle east or the mass movements developing in wisconsin in the united states just to give a few examples. there are of course already some fantastic websites already covering these events which we fully support such as the committee for a workers' international (cwi - international organisation of which the socialist party is affiliated) website and of course both the socialist party and the socialist party wales websites.

after we set her out (okay, i confess, i did burn rubber just a bit) the mister and i rode along in silence for thirty minutes. then, he looked at me and smiled, "nicest thirty minutes this week!" i giggled.

at first i was completely taken with winterôs writing; she certainly has a gift for pulling you into a story that makes you feel very unsettled, but at the same time compelled to keep reading. i was so intrigued by this helpless baby born with both female and male reproductive organs, and the decisions forced upon its parents; do they bring it up as a boy or a girl? or do they leave it, being both male and female, letting it be as it was born to be. i feel slightly cruel using the word òitô to describe a person here, but iôm not entirely sure what other word to use, so i hope it doesnôt offend anyone! the baby is soon named wayne, a decision made by his father, treadway, because of his longing for a son; someone to teach how to hunt in the wilderness of canada, someone he can sculpt into a man; a provider. but wayneôs mother, jacinta, feels very early on that wayne isnôt simply a boy, and she finds it unbearable to have to suppress wayneôs female side. she wants him to live exactly as he is, and not be forced either way. however, perhaps the biggest influence onwayneôs life is jacintaôs friend, thomasina; who recently lost both her husband and daughter in an accident. her daughterôs name was annabel, and it is by this name that she chooses to talk towayne. it is through thomasina that wayneôs female side is allowed to grow, and this has some devastating consequences for all involved.

i love italian food. my love of italian food goes beyond pizza and spaghetti. i have a longing to learn how to cook italian food from the different regions of italy. i recently discovered lida's cooking show on my local pbs cable channel. i like her format of sharing recipes from italy, which are intermingled with beautiful videos of her visiting the region from where her recipe originates. i was intrigued by her episode on sardinia, and then i watched her making a very simple pasta with two of her grandchildren! lidia explained each step so well, that she made it look so simple--so i decided i was going to make this delicious looking dish. unfortunately, i don't have any of her cookbooks (which is going to change), and this recipe was not posted on her website. the sausage tomato sauce is very similar to how i make marinara sauce, so that was easy to "wing" on my own. as for the pasta-- i had to rewind her show (i love dvr), pausing and trying to see the measurements on camera. i ended up guessing at the amount of water she used to make this very simple semolina flour "gnocchi". let me show you:

eh, i guess i'd warmed pretty significantly to clinton right before his first term, but i still thought he was too centrist for me to truly love. by the end of his first term, i was certain of that, and pulled the lever as a dutiful democrat, but with no real enthusiasm. i didn't love al gore until his damned concession speech, when i saw the glimmer of the great man within, and i wept tears of pure anger that night; anger at him, for not revealing it to us sooner.

it was fun wandering around. by the end of the day saturday the square was overcome with the smells of honk!: sweat, multiple varieties of body odor, pot. and then sunday was the great parade when the bands joined by various groups, march down mass ave from davis square in somerville to harvard square in cambridge. you see policemen, mayors, cross-dressers, people on stilts, people-wheels (you know, like a hamster-wheel but with people instead of hamsters). you see weird, you see crazy, but it is all fun and it is all good. honk! is just another thing that make me love my neighborhood.
yet, i often hear parents bragging about winning over their children in other kinds of "battles," as if it makes any more sense than it would to brag about a chess victory over a three-year-old. i see parents patting themselves and each other on the back for proving how big and strong and powerful they are. guess what, parents? your kids already know you are more powerful than they are. this is a lesson that does not need to be taught. your children are frequently reminded of how powerful you are, every time you do (or refuse to do) something for them that they cannot do for themselves.

a sudden chill settled upon her shoulders. something ominous seemed to hover in the air as the sun was obscured. she looked upward but the sky was filled with black specks, the golden ones gone. the breeze escalated into a strong wind but still the particles started to cover her. they felt evil to her and seemed to chill her to the bone. she started to run but her feet seemed frozen to the ground.

more than years since the fall of the fascistic marcosian era, the filipino is still being fed with a mediocre lieîthat this country is being confronted with a clash between socialism/communism and fascism. for decades, the leftists who benefit from our semi-free system have been spreading the false dichotomy that the choice confronting this country is only fascism or communism. they attempt to corrupt peopleôs consciousness that the philippines is being fought over by an alleged dictatorship of a right (fascism) or a left (communism), while capitalism is being ignored and eliminated, as if it had never existed at all.

a recent tax the richù scheme is the buffett rule, which is a proposal to raise taxes on individuals who earn more than $ million per year in income. warren buffett, the man who proposed it, devised his ruleù after observing that he paid a lower percentage of income taxes (%) on his $. million income in than his employees who earn less. that may sound like a wonderful and altruistic idea until one considers that buffettôs wealth has been between about $- billion in recent years. (to be fair to buffett, he does contribute a significant portion of his money to charity, much like conservatives who donate more to charity than modern liberals î despite the fact that liberals have slightly higher incomes on average.) if buffett really wanted to pay higher taxes to contribute more to the u.s. federal government (besides voluntarily sending a check to the u.s. treasury) heôd propose a wealth tax: if he paid % of his wealth in tax heôd be contributing about $ billion (using $ billion as his wealth) in taxes. a wealth tax of just % on buffett would generate $ million in tax revenues, and a wealth tax of .% would generate the same tax revenue as the % income tax rate on his $. million income (about $ million).

thatôs profoundly unfortunate, because itôs when overblown ambitions crash to the ground that hope in the true sense of the word is most needed. behind the rise and fall of the new age and the evangelical movements stands the vaster rise and fall of another attempt to build utopia here on earth, the attempt we call industrial civilization. right now, as the limits to growth tighten around us like a noose and an economy geared to perpetual expansion shudders and cracks in the throes of decline, one of the things thatôs needed most is the willingness, in a time of gathering darkness, to locate what lamps can still be found, and light them. to return to the metaphor i offered earlier, we need to listen to the voice that tells us, "honey, iôm really sorry, but santa claus isnôt coming this year"îand having heard that, and done whatever grieving we need to do, we need to draw in a deep breath, accept the hard fact, and get to work to spread at least a little light and warmth in a cold season.

when you factor in the ownership of many regional brewers as family businesses, the future brewing operation looks even more bleak. it is no longer the done thing to hand over the business to the eldest male, heterosexual, stable, married, male child producing child. the shareholding is split between all children, then between all their children and so on. each generation dilutes the shareholding and introduces shareholders with no interest in the business. some may have an interest in joining the family business, others may wish to sell up, mortgage their shareholding for the capital to go do their own thing or simply secure a liveable level of dividends for a cushy life. as one generation passes to another the chances increase of a none family member taking the helm. somebody that knows how to run a business rather than somebody that contains some of the dna of the dead guy that started it, someone with an mba and a cv, someone whose job it is to deliver dividends from the current business and seek new business rather than maintain what used to be the business but is now only an historical legacy of the founders. someone who asks why the hell are we running an expensive brewery when we make all our money out of a regional chain of restaurant pubs flogging hot diners and bottles of pinot grigio?ù

quite simply, attention to grammar and spelling, double line spacing and clear presentation help. that will alert me at the beginning that the author has a professional interest in their writing. in terms of content, i see a vast number of copycat stories ì as soon as there is a bestselling childrenôs book, we will become inundated with weak copies of it, which never works. publishers and agents are after the next big thing, not the last one. true originality is therefore very important. there may be a risk taking element at play here ì someone who doesnôt automatically think òthis is for children so weôll have to have some little animals in itô or òwe canôt have a murder mystery for childrenô will produce a less attractive text than somebody who has had a compelling story in their mind for years and sets out to make it work for children. as a rule of thumb, children are generally a great deal more sophisticated than debut authors seem to regard them.

the material chosen here is fantastic, and perfectly suited to the harper's tastes and abilities. the lead off track "cowboy" is an exceptional song, the best on the album. it's a rollicking ride across the old west, with a big bold trumpet section, flutes and a fantastic vocal performance from scoppetone. other highlights are the ragtime throwbacks "society strut" and "down at papa joe's", the spector-meets-nilsson tropicalia vibe of "banana king louie" and the stunningly mellow and jazzy "speak low". the band didn't write any of the material here, mostly choosing songs from old movie soundtracks and lesser known songs from contemporary songwriters, but again, it's stuff that suits this band perfectly.

about a week or so back i watched a video presented concerning the "ignorance" of those of us in the south. it seems that the fruitloop over at driftglass driftglass.blogspot.com wanted to inform us that we ignorant southrons had too much say in the electoral process and were ruining the country. some of the comments were pretty silly also as one can imagine. i would be offended if they weren't so ridiculous. true, the video did contain some pretty uneducated (sounding) folk, but i would rather deal with them any day than some ivy league schmuck (or windy city schmuck for that matter). now those are the folk who may truly be ruining our nation. .

true grit has some interesting things to say about frontier justice (or injustice) and what i would call american character.ù those in charge of law enforcement and justice are often unjust and guilty of lawbreaking themselves. mattie, who puts so much stock in her lawyerôs abilities to protect her familyôs property, leaves him out of her search for criminal justice and is only too eager to become a vigilante when it comes to avenging her fatherôs death. i think that that kind of thinking is widespread today. we are often called a litigious society and we still see today that people with guns are eager to take the law into their own hands (think trayvon martin). the resolution to this story and mattieôs fate made me think of an eye for an eyeù in a very literal way. mattie makes a physical sacrifice and seems to have no regrets about any of her actions.

some of you might remember that i was rather unsuccessful in securing a place for graduate school last year. moving out of the tri-state area is pretty much out of the question for me (personal reasons). this leaves me with only a handful of viable schools to apply to. the ambitious student that i am, i aimed high and applied to only well known universities. i had my eyes set for either upenn, stony brook or rutgers but unfortunately none of these universities were interested in me. it didn't help that i only applied for phd programs (in hindsight, i really should have looked into a few masters program). i realized now that you have higher chances of being accepted to a masters program compared to most phd program. unless, of course, you have a . gpa or a perfect . gpa. that, i do not have unfortunately.

gladstone's triumphant budget of secured his place among the first rank of british politicians. he carried it through against considerable initial opposition within the cabinet itself, especially from the two rival aspirants to the chancellorship, wood and graham. his budget speech's success derived in part from his mastery of budget history, but even more from his determination to reconstruct government finance in a more rational manner. in a step devised to increase prosperity, he reduced customs duties. he made up for the lost revenue by extending income tax for seven years and also applying to somewhat lower incomes and to ireland. since the income tax was unpopular, and gladstone himself was on record opposing it, the trick was to make this extension palatable. he accomplished this by extending the tax in a way as to put britain on a path to doing away with it, by setting it at a gradually declining rate (at the end of which it would be expected that greater prosperity would bring in sufficient revenues without it, though from what sources is not clear to me, anyway).
the good news is, i liked it. it's good and often it's very good. jennifer lawrence is awesome; she is an amazing actress and she nailed everything. she had exactly the right chemistry with all the other characters: prim, cinna, rue - and peeta and gale. obviously many things from the book are condensed for the movie, but even though katniss and gale only have about five minutes of screen time together, you still got it - that they are best friends, maybe more - and that's entirely due to how much lawrence can convey with only a few words and gestures. the other actors are fine, but it's difficult to point out anyone else as a standout. it's totally lawrence's show, and as she's the lead, that's how it should be. there's no doubt that this katniss can inspire a revolution.

giving in to the temptation of a perkier model doesn't make trump a bad man. but it doesn't make him a good one, either. this is what used to be known - quaintly - as "the character question". a man's character doesn't interest modern culture that much any more. bulk media prefer narcissism and self-expression to doing the right thing and selflessness. unfortunately, where television dwells, so go the people. mostly, anyway.

when the top of the pops re-runs began last spring, a lot of people saw them as evidence that was pop's worst ever year. this could only be said by people who hadn't lived through the cheap thrills of the glam era only to be left high and dry by the tame, tawdry charts of . to put in context, let me explain the desperation of pop music a year earlier. only twice in my life have i left the charts alone - for a few months in when i was an indie puritan, and in early when i simply lost interest. i bought and devoured shoot! and football took up all my headspace. only for a few months, but for pop to have fallen off the radar of the ten-year old me so completely that i didn't know who was number one, still shocks the adult me.
crying for no reason, feeling emotionally vulnerable: when blockages from this lifetime, and other lifetimes began to release the emotional body will react in this manner. the photon belt energy stimulates and contributes to the spontaneous release of these burdens. trying to control or resists these urges further represses and blocks the energy making things more difficult. crying, moaning, sobbing or toning becomes a cleansing release. use a bach flower remedy, or an essential oil to help with the emotional body.

i disagree: the goal is to be truthful, not confident. the ego wants to play its little game of confidence; the soul wants truth. and the truth is we are all fallible; none of us is omniscient. and that should lead to some real humility, some real openness, not arrogance and faux-confidence. the goal is not to be confident in all that you do in say; the goal is to be mindful, to be as aware as possible, and to be open to admitting when youôre wrong when you are indeed wrong.

is it a system seller? no, not even for those of us who have played every one since metal gear solid and for those who know nothing about nothing, theyôre just going to turn off the console because they didnôt expect cutscenes that last for half-an-hour. speaking as a fan, the problem with metal gear solid is how un-metal gear solid it is. you go around the world, visiting multiple locations, while in previous installments you were more or less wandering around one, like shadow moses or tselinoyarsk and their environs. there are only two people you can call on the codec and saving is done in a menu. the missions, and i canôt believe an mgs has missions plural instead of a mission like operation snake eater, are all linear. there is no backtracking. itôs like the second these old series jumped on to the new generation they dropped most of their established conventions, the conventions that made them, to make the jump. resident evil suffered from this exact same thing. this linearity hurts all the new features they put in. there is a ton of guns with customizable parts, you can roll onto your back while crawling and your camo, to my disappointment, is automatic. the worst travesty however is the utter removal of an mgs staple: procure on site. thereôs a damn store in your pause menu to buy any and all guns and the necessary ammo. and you can take the weapons of dead enemies and use them, after unlocking them of course. but in truth, you donôt need all these new features to beat the game. theyôre superfluous. very, very superfluous. once i got the m i got through the entire game with just it, i didnôt need any other gun nor did i need all those cool attachments. for the boss fights i used the saiga loaded with the rubber ring ammo to get the facemasks and that gun doesnôt even have customization. i only once rolled onto my back on the last mission and that was by pure accident. the only time i used the oil drum was when i got it and that only amounted in rolling around in a circle before i got bored and shot someone. unlike in metal gear solid , where you needed to keep your stamina up, you needed to dig out the bullets and sew those cuts close; you donôt need all this new shit.

there's definitely a place for opinion journalism. msnbc's full lineup now is opinion journalism, as is fox news'. the difference is that for the most part, msnbc hosts' claims can be backed up with something demonstrable, whereas fox is all about pulling stuff out of roger ailes' ass and reporting it as truth. imagine if fox really were a counterpoint to msnbc, one in which two differing view of how things ought to be done could actually be compared to each other and argued on the merits.
annie/liam/vanessa- liam and vanessa are chatting at the bar about tattoos and such, when annie comes by asking for liamôs copy of zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance for dixon. that is, of course, a lie, as annie just wants to get vanessa alone so she can tell her she knows everything and to stay away from liam!!! vanessa tells annie sheôs got no idea what sheôs capable of and annie tells vanessa she wonôt tell liam about her idôs if she leaves. later, annie comes by looking for liam and adrianna tells her that liam and vanessa went out of town. annie says she has to find out where they went and tells adrianna about the car/id situation. adrianna says that annie could be wrong and could be pushing liam away. we then see liam and vanessa on a bridge eating some food. liam tells vanessa again that he wants to be in a relationship with her, not annie. vanessa then says she has something to show him. vanessa leads the duo to a house, where she tells liam she hit him with her car and that sheôs been in trouble with the law before. annie then shows up out of the blue.
the nik software already has made me rely less on my photoshop skills by allowing me to make subtle as well as tonal changes without individual layer masks. it also wakes up the echoes of my photo darkroom supervisor in heidelberg, germany: herr tkach was a soft spoken formal man from czechoslavakia. he worked at the army headquarters in heidelberg and ran the photo darkroom which was available to all military and civilian personnel assigned to headquarters. he experimented with his color landscape photos of heidelberg and one, a x solarizedù print, was completely unrecognizable as heidelberg. thatôs the one i liked.
unfortunately, the middle and high schools that these children move onto, more often than not, do not offer them the same quality of education as their primary school has. the children will have to walk for at least an hour each way to get to school, and sadly, some girls won't even continue on as they are kept at home to help around the house.

now over to new agers. pretty much the same thing with us. we believe in angels and saints. we believe that a saint from any religion can help us because they have reached a level of enlightenment much higher than the average person at present and will not care about such petty things as what name you attribute to god. if you call on them they will come, be you catholic, protestant, buddhist, agnostic or new ager. it doesnôt matter, you called for help they will come and do what they can (understand however itôs more of a whispering in your ear to see the opportunities to earn what you want or to get out of the situation you want to get out of, or at least to calm or strengthen you as the situation and request may call for). (more along the lines of what you saw in the movie city of angels than in itôs a wonderful life).

- finally, franklin doesn't exist in a vacuum - washington and classon to the west are blowing up just as fast (if you're looking for a symbol of gentrification, look no further than the kinky krown cocktail at the bearded lady - in the former kinky krowns salon spot - on washington), and to the east, nostrand has witnessed a spate of openings in the past year that range from high-end to light-industrial (nobar, an auto body shop, and many more - nostrand park, i'd love to see your list for your avenue!). in last week's openings post, some folks were discussing these issues, so to close, i'll pose some of the same questions they ask: what are your takeaways from the rapid development of northwest crown heights, and how does franklin figure in the larger picture, as compared to washington/classon/rodgers/bedford/nostrand)? how about franklin south of eastern parkway (where the past year has seen the opening of a metropcs and roti 'n dumplings, a series of storefront renovations, and the promise of another bob & betty's?)? what do these changes mean, practically, for you and for the neighborhood at large? finally, even though change is the only constant, it looks different neighborhood to neighborhood (the process is not the same in williamsburg as in fort greene, to take two prominent and well-covered examples). how can/should we, as residents, merchants, and landlords, seek to channel this change in the service of building a healthy community that serves everyone, longtime locals and new arrivals, on franklin avenue? is it possible?

there is something so intriguing about the show. from the manor itself to all of the characters who live in it, it seems that you never know what is coming next. it is the perfect combination of mischief and mayhem and romance. my favorite part is that the story told is not just of the priveleged class, but that they also look into the lives of the manor's staff. even further, they allow you to see the relationships that develop between the family that owns downton and the staff.

my first oncology appointment was this morning at am. i met with a nurse who weighed me and took my blood pressure and asked me a few questions about my medical history. then i saw the oncologist/hematologist who really didnôt tell me anything i didnôt already know. he went over my ct results with me (confirmed the size and location of the mass) and took a detailed family/personal medical history. he also told me i would be having a ct-guided needle biopsy (they will be sticking a needle in me, probably through my back, and into the mass to collect a sample) sometime in the next week or two, and one week after that i would see him again and he would be performing a bone marrow biopsy. i am not looking forward to either one of these procedures. i hear they are quite painful.

some alterations show the influence of painting over the composition of photograph, some cropping and brushing serves simply to create pleasing compositions, but most of the revisions seem to come from extra-aesthetic reasons either political or personal. in one publicity photo, mao walks next to a gentleman and waves to the public. mao is taller than the man and dominates the scene with his inherent charisma and personality. this man, however, is eliminated from the photograph anyway. who was that man? why was he removed? can we safely assume that he fell out of favor with the chairman or is this just our bias in viewing the working of a so called communistù mentality? another photograph shows a group of aviators posing in front of combat jet. the altered photograph shows that three of the men have simply vanished. this is the shadowy world of images, the working of those behind closed doors that can never be known.

the consistency of the organic yoghurt and the vaalia is almost identical when scooped from the tub. however the vaalia has added the maize (corn) thickener, why? likely that the product was quite thin to start with, as the labelling does say the yoghurt contains water (unlike the gipssland product). is this a money saving exercise to spread the product further? is it cheaper to add maize thickener than just add more yoghurt? who knows. the maize thickener () is found in many packaged products from muesli & snack bars, to gravy, to packet cake mixes. its a similar story for the gelatin.

this recipe is a vegetarian play on the traditional english friday night take-away dish: battered fish with mushy peas & tartare sauce you would get from the local fish & chip shop. they had me at battered halloumi, but the addition of minty mushy peas really sealed it for me. the tartare sauce recipe is mine. i donôt like capers or gherkins (cornichons) so i substituted them for pickled onions, which i love, and it worked! i also added some coriander as well as parsley. the result is better than any tartare sauce youôve ever tried, i promise. the addition of the nori seaweed is from the book and is, i have to say, genius. nori seaweed is what you use make sushi rolls and the flavour of the sea it gives to the sauce is so spot on, once youôve tried it youôll wonder why youôve never done it before.

buddhism doesnôt concern itself with the same questions, and is therefore focused on something other than the arguments that have been plaguing christians and jews for centuries, if not millennia. the buddha himself said he was not interested in the question of whether or not there was a god, and therefore focused his efforts and attention in a whole different direction. buddhism (when not practiced in a rote or devotional way, like anything else) is deeply experiential by nature. it has a built-in outù in that the buddha basically said look, try this, and decide based on your experience, not what i say.ù this is extraordinarily appealing to folks who have probably already broken a number of rules by venturing far enough outside their birth faith to marry someone raised in another faith. buddhism has countless practices that, if applied skillfully, can significantly assist in the process of transforming suffering, no matter what someoneôs religiousù orientation may be.

it blows my mind that iôve now read issues of bleach, and iôm still so microscopically behind in the overall plot of the series. the last issue to be published in japan was  to put this into perspective. now, if i maintain the momentum iôm at (which is reading issues in a little over a month), i could theoretically catch up with the manga in about six and a half months. i donôt really see that happening because thereôs not even a guarantee that iôll still be this invested in the story a month from now. our heroes have finally reached the soul society, and for better or worse, bleach has officially become a very different comic from the quirky urban fantasy that i was unironically enjoying when i first began this series. i can already see how itôs becoming a more standard shonen series. the universe is still intriguing so i donôt care too much (though having watched the professionally translated anime as iôm reading the shoddily fan-translated manga, iôm growing tired of how shitty the translation work is in the version of the manga i read), but i can definitely see where this jarring transition rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. also, tite kubo keeps introducing an endless stream of new characters without giving any of these newbies a chance to really develop which is becoming semi-distracting.

in february , monarchy was overthrown in france and the country was proclaimed a republic. power passed into the hands of the bourgeoisie. they deceived the working class, the main force of the revolution, by taking the most influential workersô leader louis blanc into the provisional government. in may they consolidated their power, abandoned louis blanc and other popular leaders and went on an offensive against the proletariat. the latter responded with the june uprising which was ruthlessly crushed. on december the same year elections to the presidency of the republic took place. louis napoleon bonaparte, nephew of napoleon i the emperor ì an obscure hedonist engaged in the pursuit of thrills and melodrama and leading the life of a princely vagabond, became a candidate. to the utter surprise of all, he won on the support extended by the impoverished small-holding peasantry who believed that a man named napoleon would bring all the past glory back to them. in december , he staged a coup and seized absolute power. a year later he formally abolished the republic and declared himself emperor of the second empire, napoleon iii.

we tried something new this time with spacers. normally, i frame without glass or acrylic, but my cousin asked if we could put something over the stitching to keep it cleaner. since we were framing without a mat, i did a little reading on the site and found the spacers. they come in long sticks that are easy to cut and fit into the frame, and worked like a charm to provide an air space between the acrylic (most online places will not sell and ship glass) and the stitching itself. now that we know how well it works, i'll definitely be doing it again for a few pieces i plan on hanging in our kitchen. they won't be right near the sink or stove, but i'd like to give them that extra layer of protection anyway.
the essence of these lessons to me as a child was that i was not the center of the universe. and, parenting styles change over the years and weôve moved towards a more child-centered approach. i am not knocking this, as i am not a parent and in my classes i advocate a student-centered approach. as i see it, a childôs natural behavior is to do things like interrupt, need attention at inopportune times and take up all the energy of the adults around them. i get it. i want all the attention too. but what i know, and what many of my parent friends have discovered, is that behaving as if the childôs needs are the only needs in the room does little to support self-initiative or responsibility. these skills are important if we are to succeed in our endeavorsîboth personal and worldly.

one of the first things i remember thinking, that i continued thinking throughout the entire game, was "wow. that is a lot of red!" we were sporting our purple pride for sure, but they had almost double the amount of fans in the stands. now, don't let the lopsided numbers fool you... this comparison might help put things in prospective:
we slowly and methodically kill our creative selves by consistently doing nothing with our ideas.

today i was catching up on a blog i enjoy, and the post i was reading was mostly photos of a camelia bush...a bird's nest...and some amazingly bright blue robin's eggs in the nest. so simple and perfect. so gorgeous and symbolic of spring. and suddenly, i started crying.
ok, so skating wasn't so bad... got to see several friends i've been missing. kids had fun. so not too bad. ok. i can stand running over to big lots. i only have to get things. i can do this. gallon zipper bags and quart zipper bags. i know right where they are, i can just go straight in there and get them... in and out in five. ready, set, hut! okay, here i go... neeeeroouuunyyyahhh.... zooming thru the parking lot & into the door... ooo, baskets... no! i'm on a mission! zipper bags, at the back, blinders on, in and out... in and out... i think i can, i think i can, i think i can... ok, right back here, around this corner....

we were extremely pleased to have ron and yvonne stop and see us this week.. they are rvôers and wheelers staying in the campground here at north ranch and heading over to qz in the near future. they have been reading my blog for a while and unbelievably, they are from custer, south dakota. they have a big ranch just south of pringle. it was good to meet them and i hope we get a chance to get better acquainted, here or up in sd. sorry i forgot to get a picture, but i will next time!
i started him on solid food. and since he is my th kid and i am sick of fighting the rice cereal battle, i went straight for apples. much better. he has only had them a handful of time so far and was frankly appalled at what i was putting in his mouth at first, but now he likes them better. that's good because this kid seems hungry a lot lately. i think we will try a veggie this week and then add another fruit.

so what of roy? letôs be honest, it didnôt really work out at liverpool. perhaps if behind the scenes circumstances had been different he might have had a better ride and been afforded more patience? as it is the overriding experience is of a liverpool side stifled by a rigid if well organised system, what would roy have done with a player like luis suarez? then again perhaps we could say that the players werenôt flexible enough to meet his demands as it is gerrard and johnson will get another chance to come to terms with royôs world!

friday, january. the cold out of doors at ten this forenoon was more intense, to my apprehension, than i ever remember. my beard froze, the nape of the neck, & the heart, seemed paralyzed, headache came on, & at the end of the short walk from here to whitehall i was almost helpless. at , i walked westward, thinking to call on the thackerays. the horseguards parade & the mall were one sheet of snow, with paths trodden but not swept: a thick brown fog brooded over it, deepening the twilight; muffled spectral figures hurried to & fro across the slippery ground. . . . in victoria street a girl begged of me: a ragged tall lusty girl of , by name caroline randall, by trade an ironer; who has no home; who slept last night on a step in a sheltered corner, & felt 'as cold as a frog', she said.

meanwhile, in a move that will surely give a significant boost to liverpoolôs hopes of regaining their status as the biggest club on merseyside, dirk kuyt looks to be on his merry way to the free and hanseatic city of hamburg. kuyt has a year left on his contract with liverpool but the dutchman is set to be swooned by the bleached-bearded lothario that is thorsten fink, a man who looks like he spends his weekends in front of a wind machine recreating classic take that videos wearing nothing more than a pair of dungarees and a i-canôt-believe-this-has-ended-like-this-when-we-had-so-much-going-for-us look. he has class, and he is also a fighter. there is nothing more that needs to be said about the quality of this player,ù alleged fink of kuyt. more good news for l iverpool fans comes in the form of the imminent signing of clearasil-skinned striker luuk de jong.

for the first time, i understood why learning was somewhat easy for me. why i didnôt have to study as much as others, why i wasnôt fearful of testing. i was a smart girl. the week i returned to high school following testing week, my english teacher had changed my seat in her classroom. i was moved into the first row, into the third seat behind two caucasian girls, and in front of debbie, another black student. for the rest of our school years, dependant on our english testing scores and reports, debbie and i would be shifted accordingly by the veteran english teacher who placed you in her classroom by unit grades. later, in the th grade, i moved into the second seat of row , behind vivian crouse. at graduation in , vivian was the valedictorian of our class. over the course of time spent in d-, the black and white girls somehow determined that we were more alike than unlike. we grew to respect one another. we talked about the methods used for setting us apart by the so-called educatedù professionals in charge. vivian, tessie, debbie, and i became outspoken advocates about prejudice, often voicing and questioning the behaviors we witnessed in the classroom we shared. younger members of the faculty were more just, more equitable in their treatments of the student body. in my senior year, when ms. g tried to box me into her list of black authors for black studentôs choices for senior term paper subjects, i stood my ground once more as i insisted on selecting my author from the first listing she had passed earlier to the otherù students. she acquiesced and asked what writer i had chosen ì louisa may alcottù, i replied. i wrote about little women, my favorite book, and film. i earned an a+ on the paper, and ms. g asked if she could keep it. i said noù. somehow, i just knew that she wanted to keep it as a souvenir, or a memento of the black girl who managed to pass and exceed all of her qualification tests.
no further information is available at this stage, since the media and the news do not consider it important enough news to publish much regarding black on white attacks. it will probably only reach the news in a couple of days when the news will have lost it's impact.

today, when i came back from my session, i noticed a dandelion growing in my lawn. i stopped and picked it, brought it inside and burned it. i hate weeds. the smell in my house had gotten worse and the burning weeds didnôt help, so i threw up a few times in my blue bathroom. i brushed my teeth right after to get the grungy taste out of my mouth. i brushed the left side for thirty seconds, then the right side, and ended with brushing the middle for forty five seconds. i flossed my teeth too. it made my gums bleed. there was a fly on the corner of the sink, it was fat and dead. i squished it. squishing things feels nice under my fingers, but it makes a mess so i do not do it all the time. after i squished the fat dead fly i wiped it up using a tissue from the tissue box on the shelf that was labeled tissues and threw it away in the gray trash can labeled trash can.

just as in classical economic marxism certain groups, i.e. workers and peasants, are a priori good, and other groups, i.e., the bourgeoisie and capital owners, are evil. in the cultural marxism of political correctness certain groups are good,ù for instance feminist women. similarly, white males are determined automatically to be evil, thereby becoming the equivalent of the bourgeoisie in economic marxism.ù both economic and cultural marxism have a method of analysis that automatically gives the answers they want. for the classical marxist, itôs marxist economics. for the cultural marxist, itôs deconstruction. deconstruction essentially takes any text, removes all meaning from it and re-inserts any meaning desired.ù

as tris tries to cope with the guilt of what happened in divergent, she is often on the brink of a destructive breakdown or self-sacrifice. she is on an emotional and grief-ridden roller coaster, which makes her far more human and understandable than someone like peter. she is strength and vulnerability and flaws and selflessness. and i love her! however tris's behaviour puts a huge strain on her relationship with four which is tested to the limits as they cross between loving and trusting, to unsure and troubled. it adds so much more interest and realism than if everything had been hunky-dory.

mustard based bbq sauces were developed by german immigrants who came to the region in the th century. they were used to that type sauce back in germany, so they brought it with them. well, everyone in that part of the country cooks a lot of pork. i mean a lot of pork. and those german immigrants combined their mustard sauces with the pulled pork and an amazing transformation occurred! that smoke cooked pork, already an amazing taste treat by itself, moved up to an alternate plane of existence! the bite of the mustard and the fruitiness of the apple cider vinegar combined to make an awesome sauce that made the pork shine like gold, okay the yellow mustard accounts for the gold color, but it still shines!

so lets review what we know so far:
let's start from the very beginning. 'digital' means relating to or made from numbers. in terms of information technology, it means anything that can be reduced to the binary state of being stored as and , or 'charge' and 'no charge' on a magnetic disk, tape, yadayadayada. a paper book has extension in -d space and cannot be stored as a sequence of s and s. however, it is produced (these days) from computer files that are digitally stored. you could see distributing and consuming books in digital form as a way of cutting out the final stage (paper). that's effectively what an e-book does.

i would furthermore say that by the failure of president obama to have taken this step last month he has already violated his oath of office. one of the laws he is required to faithfully execute requires that he prevent the debt of the united states from being questioned. yet by his inaction the debt of the united states is, right now, being questioned--and is being increasingly questioned more and more as time passes.upyernoz / rubber hose: platinum, baby, platinum

this basket took some time to prepare--thus the time needed to start tea tuesdays again. each of these bags (the boxes and tins were fine as is) are kept in their own ziplock storage bags normally. to undo each of these--and keep them all in order to be properly restored . . . well, that takes effort. but look at the pretty display. mind you, these are only the teas kept in my "everyday" cupboard. i have a whole host of others for back-up--like well over a kilo (in total) of my various favorites so i never, ever run out (until my next restocking).

at the heart of this, i wonder why dr cruddas in particular was invited by the las casas institute? there are many mps to invite, so the reason is unlikely to be his membership of the commons. i hazard that it is his catholicism and perhaps his affiliation to the labour party. but, as i have said above, his distorted understanding of the catholic faith is a scandal because he is a public figure. there seems to be an assumption in this country that to be catholic is to be labour. this naivete reached a nadir in the fawning displayed by our church over that most reprehensible couple tony and cherie blair. in mr blairôs case, i cannot understand how he could be received into the church without a public abjuration of his erroneous beliefs and practices - for example, his own voting record on abortion. these were errors he committed before he became a catholic, but they were in the public sphere, and his reception as a catholic without any recantation is a continuing scandal.

the irony! since the late s a number of academics, consultants, professional associations and think tanks have been making the case for the introduction of tax increment financing (tif) into the uk. this is a model based on debt-creation whereby a political entity ì such as a local government ì establishes a project area, sometimes on its own, sometimes through consultation with business, community and neighbourhood groups. the property taxes (business rates in the uk) in the project area are then frozen. the local government then borrows money against the project òupliftô or òincrementô, on the basis that if they spend the borrowed money on clean up, infrastructure, and other upfront activities then developers will come in and, well, develop! the belief is that this will lead to an increase in property values (business rates in the uk) and this òincrementô will go to the political entity to pay off the debt and to reinvest in the project area. after a period of time ì normally around twenty five years ì the debt will have been paid off, the project area gets dissolved and the property tax returns to going to the normal taxing authorities.

hawkeye, on the other hand, doesn't really work outside the context of the avengers. people have tried, certainly: he's even developed a small but respectable solo rogues gallery, mostly composed of people from clint barton's past who have a mad-on for whatever reason. but he doesn't have any projects, any real reason to operate, outside his team. he doesn't have green arrow's social conscience to propel his characterization. hawkeye grew up a poor orphan, a boy who literally ran away to join the circus and learned everything he needed at the feet of some extremely dubious characters. for hawkeye, being an avenger is the best job in the world, certainly more than almost anyone else in his position could ever have dreamed of accomplishing. whenever he's left the team - to have his own "hard traveling hero" moments, or to gain perspective on whatever recent setback he suffered - it's always been temporary, and often when he's left the main avengers group it's been for the purpose of founding or joining another group, such as the west coast avengers or the thunderbolts.

this behavior went on for at least two years, in part because many were hesitant to call her out. after all, she supposedly had a glowing reputation and a lot of endorsements. some had met her in person: in other words, this wasn't some perv-dude in his mom's basement, or even somebody's sister in male drag a la jt leroy. and she appeared to have a lot going on in her personal life: unemployment, a sick pet, relatives in distress. most of all, she just seemed so nice!
iôve been thinking a lot about what love is. weôve been through tons of research on all of the emotional difficulties that come with bringing a child into your home who has never truly experienced a loving, nurturing and safe environment and a good deal of it talks about how bonding with a child who has never experienced that level of love begins with the meeting of basic needs and, ultimately, sacrificing my emotional need to get love in return for my actions. the truth is, it may take weeks or months before trust is built and our child can genuinely show us love in return. itôs made me think a lot about what biblical love is. i think in our culture weôve reduced love to squishy feelings and sentiments, to hearts and teddy bears. we throw corinthians in every wedding ceremony because of itôs romantic, flowery language about speaking in tongues of men and angels, but we never really stop to consider what a hard line it is to walk. love isnôt conditional, love is what happens when you meet a need without considering the reward. thatôs tough.

mindful slow eating, or being aware and present while dining can have a huge impact on your waistline without necessarily changing what you eat. it takes about minutes from when you first begin eating for your brain to become aware that your stomach is full. when is the last time a meal took you minutes to eat and didnôt leave you adjusting your belt? the point is that when we eat quickly and we arenôt paying attention, we eat more calories than we need to in order to feel full. the university of rhode island has done several studies to back up this theory and found links between bmi and rate of eating and gender differences too. the first study they did in shows when asked to eat quickly until the point of fullness, their subjects ate on average more calories per meal then when they were asked to eat slowly and the subjects felt hungrier after the fast paced meal. at three meals a day for one week thatôs , extra calories. one year would mean , extra calories which makes up about pounds. pretty astounding, right? the great news is this information can be used to our advantage in the battle of the bulge.

halong city, while no beauty, still enjoys a fantastic view across its eponymous bay, and is not without charm. as the centrepiece for the victory day celebrations, the beach and town were teeming with vietnamese middle-class families in festive mood. hotels were again charging a premium, with even the pokiest dirtiest rooms going for $. after a lot of searching and a bit of haggling we settled on $ (a bargain at just twice the normal rate) and hit the beach in time for sunset. the beer drinking, ice cream slurping and shellfish shucking was in full flow as was the souvenir buying and mobile phone-camera snapping (the vietnamese certainly embrace capitalism when celebrating victory over its greatest proponents) and we got stuck in. after a hilariously disappointing clam soup (i was thinking chowder, the chef was thinking a thimbleful of pond water complete with a couple of snails) we toured the pop-up food stalls until we could barely move, all the while enjoying the buzz and chatter of the street party, and the lack of the backpacker pitched banana pancakes/happy hour options. what fickle folk we are¶

what i like is the way they we see houtarouôs thinking process. itôs not the typical flashback with characters thing or just a close-up of his face. the images are moving in the way heôs thinking about all of this. what this anime also does right is that it doesnôt rely on random deux ex machina as much as some other detectives sometimes do. even before the part with the paint smell i was thinking about the book being used for some kind of class already just by the ways houtarou pushed us. he doesnôt do some weird tricks, this is pure realistic logic that we could also have solved. even without the smell of paintù thing they could have solved it. the smell was just to speed everything up so the case could be wrapped up in ten minutes. like last episode they did an amazing job in making me interested in the story and giving us a satisfying end.

schools who participate in the federal school lunch program get federal subsidies to provide their programs and to provide free and reduced lunches to individuals in need. they must meet certain nutritional requirements that often are at the local districtôs discretion (and often ignored, perhaps for the better?). i am hopeful most districts meet or exceed the federal guidelines for nutrition, especially the newest fda proposals. but, itôs the selection that is troubling to me. canned peaches or fresh peaches, which sounds more appealing to you? yet the reality of a school cafeteria is that they need to provide choices that their pickiest eaters will like. there is a reason why schools stand by the tried and true grilled cheese, chicken nuggets, and pizza choices that they provide. perhaps some of this is more of a reflection of parenting and our nutrition choices within our home?

there was a vivid moment where we were standing on the front porch of a mutual friend, the day the daughter ran away. the mom was telling us about the conversation that she'd had with the counselor and the reason that they wouldn't let her come and get her daughter. since the daughter had accused her mom of abusing her, they had to investigate. i remember saying something about how silly that was and surely it wasn't true. the mother had admitted to slapping her daughter in the face once when she was really really upset and had immediately regretted it and apologized. the mom told us that her husband accused her of abusing the kids all the time and that the daughter was simply repeating what she'd heard. she was lamenting how unfair it was to be accused of abuse and how terrible it was for her husband to say such things. her husband walked up around this time and over heard part of the conversation. all of us standing there on the porch told him that he shouldn't accuse his wife of abuse when she's not abusive.

it is now clear that this acknowledgment, which was ignored in media coverage of the briefing, was a reference to isi's providing the cia with both the cell phone number of arshad khan and the fact that it belonged to the owner of the compound in abbottabad. the unnamed official was confirming indirectly that until isi had given it that information, the cia had not focused on the abbottabad compound as the likely location of bin laden's courier, or, therefore, of bin laden himself.

creek crossings: this trail has a couple of creeks that feed the lake, and both of the creeks are substantial enough that they require footbridges. the first is at approximately the .-mile mark. you get a good view of a circuitous creek and the bridge as you descend from a high bluff. you will cross a second creek about three miles into the hike. it also has a high bluff that offers an aerial view of the creek and bridge. this bluff is so steep that the trail has a stone stairway and a hand-railing.

battles were incredibly fast, and the exploration was rife with many common fun-house dungeon features, including magic pools and trapped treasures. the game almost played like first edition basic/ad&d. circumstances of many of the fights, such as cramped conditions and difficult terrain meant that most characters only took single actions on their rounds. this and the fact that the characters had only a few spells, skills, or weapons, meant that their main actions were usually straight-forward and quick to resolve. one of the classic hallmarks of low level play, besides character frailty, is limited options, and first level pathfinder characters are no exception, though they made sure that every character had something worth doing every turn. and just as i hoped, the complete lack of opportunity attacks meant that much less emphasis was made on positioning, which sped up play vastly, and sometimes the miniatures and battle-mat were no more than afterthoughts.

from the entire fabric of paulôs christology, it is apparent that paul saw jesus as participating in godôs attributes and roles, as sharing in the divine glory¶but neither in the jewish background of paul nor in his own usage (unlike johnôs) did the language of divine sonship in itself attribute divinity. in paulôs jewish tradition to call a human figure godôs òsonô meant primarily to attribute to him a special standing, status and favor with god. paulôs references to jesus as the òsonô of god meant that jesus possessed a unique standing, status and favor with god.[]

the reason why people love this new type of eating is because it brings the opportunity to have multiple restaurants available at the same time. this is because the new food truck owners tend to travel together. for example, they travel to parks and art events like the wynwood art walk offering their unique cuisine among their team or food truck family.

a few seconds later, and out came tyler, into his daddy's hands, .am - maybe twenty minutes since my waters broke. he had been moving himself, rotating his shoulders and turning in the birth canal, and i felt every single part of that journey. my husband passed him to me, through my legs, and i held him to my chest. my perfect baby. my perfect birth.

funny and completely out of context is the story with the names. here in colombia almost everyone has four names (two names and two surnames). well when they heard my name, they asked me thatôs all!?ù or isnôt that a bit boring!?ù or something like that what do you do, if you have a double ganger, a person with the same nameù¶well in fact i do have a third name and many persons of my nationality too, nowadays we have the trend of double names after a marriage moreover, but the names here seems to be without end. i always have the problems how to call the persons. so in the worst case i call a male person: juan or camilo and for the females i would guess: ana, angela or maria¶well it stays difficult. but back to my third name¶.my third name is anita. whenever some of my german friends heard that name..he/she was singing anita,anitaù (costa cordalis) or just laughing over this name. but here in colombia anitaù actually doesnôt exist. anita is a diminution form of ana. so everyone was delighted over my other name and liked it very much. this was a completely different experience.
there may never be a need to teach the clean/unclean foods in your special needs program or ministry. however, you may want to begin to consider the foods you are eating out of concern for your own health.
as we were eating, miss picky-pants was inquiring what each ingredient in the soup was. iôm always torn between being honest, and having her decide that she wont be consuming that, thank you very much, and telling her that everything is made of chocolate, in the hope that she might believe me and eat everything quickly and nicely. last night i opted for the former, informing her that the items-in-question were lentils.
so in order to prove that she is capable of earning a living, i motioned the court for a vocational study to determine her employability in todayôs marketplace. with her active license and her education level, the wife went off to the evaluator, who is a psychologist, for testing. the testing most likely will result in the conclusion that the wife is employable at some salary. therefore my clientôs (husband) obligation to pay a hefty alimony will be diminished because of the law of alimony, which is wifeôs need in this case and husbandôs ability to pay. her need will be lowered by my proving to the judge that she can work and earn something. her children are grown and i do believe the judge will take all of those findings into consideration in a lower alimony award than she expects.

invasion starts off with colt taking part in a series of tests for secret organization. the book quickly jumped to colt living a normal life until his parents are killed in a car crash. this car crash leaves him to leave his home in california and lived with his grandfather in arizona. colt doesn't believe that his parents were killed naturally but instead believes that there could be some type of cover-up going on. as colt tries to uncover the mystery behind his parents death cult discovers that the world is much larger than he believes and uncovers a secret government organization and a corporate conspiracy.
despite the existence of many studies describing the negative effects of mercury on the human brain, governments still push for the increased vaccination of the population with shots containing thimerosal. furthermore, governing bodies have protected the pharmaceutical companies who produce the vaccines and foods containing hfcs against any type of lawsuits. the fact that many high executives of these companies also hold key positions within the government, might provide an explanation. there are indeed a restricted amount of persons holding positions of high power in both the private and public sector. these people, in what are clear cases of conflict of interest, collide at the top to form what this site refers to as the eliteù or the ruling class.ù most of these people have never been elected to governmental positions, yet they create public policies that further their agenda, regardless of the political party in power. look at the membership of the bilderberg group, the committee of or the council of foreign relations and you will find the ceos of companies producing your food and medication ¶ and the same people who pass laws governing your food and medication.

i'm fixing it. aforementioned massage guy, who works with lots and lots of crazy runners, said something to me the other day that pretty much smacked me in the head. he said (and i can't remember, so i'll paraphrase) that i need to start running as just one thing that i do, not because i'm a runner, but because i'm a healthy person who likes exercise and values being fit. it may be my favorite, but it's not the only thing in my life and it will no longer be the thread that holds my sanity together. he's right. i don't know how it got to that point - holy crap, probably millions of times i've thought back to when i intensely hated the very idea of running, and wondered how the heck i could evolve into a creature so dependent on it. but that's done. running is a part of the whole picture. running is something i enjoy. and it's turned into this ugly monster that is fueled by numbers and desperate fights for pr's and training plans. not that any of those things are bad - they're great in their place. but for me and my brain, running has become much more of a big deal than it should be. it's turned into an obsession that didn't feel unhealthy at all until it was gone and i probably would've sold my soul to the devil for a good -miler.

first, i do not believe carter has provided sufficient reasons to justify a wholesale abandonment of the sectarian-synagogal reading of john. he superficially addresses concerns about synagogue expulsion and intra-community conflict and seemingly only as a means to dismissing it to provide his own interpretive grid. in every generation the majority opinions of scholarship need to be reexamined, if only to remind scholars why those opinions have been so influential. carter is to be applauded for his attempt to question the consensus, though his alternative to the two-level reading is not convincing.

the media is littered with malemaôs contemptuous dismissals of those who are not in his camp, from political opponents to journalists, and extending to colleagues in the anc who donôt share his views. his aggressive and angry outbursts suggest a poor capacity to regulate his rage at those who anger him, which is often a hallmark of somebody who is easily narcissistically wounded.

"disappointing" is the word i would use to describe this new hotel. ritz hotels around the world are managed by different companies and have varying arrangements for the use of the ritz name. the name is synonymous with luxury accommodation, but one can see that in this case, the style is far removed from what made ritz hotels famous. cesar ritz himself selected decor of the louis xvi period, actually a revival of the style years after the original. he adopted modern principals of hygiene and ventilation, and wooed the greatest chefs, sommeliers, and service people to create an environment reminiscent of a beautifully managed palace.

the release of insulin should be nice and slow and in spurts...so the complex unrefined unprocessed carbohydrates allow for this to happen. too much sugar in the blood in any form can cause the production of too much insulin which the liver will then store it as fat or lipids. lipids are also the fat that over time can clog your arteries. so even too high of good carbs can be bad for people if they have too much other sugars charging their blood stream creating insulin.

if you want to lose weight using yoga as your primary workout, you are going to need to commit to a fast-paced practice, ideally every day. ashtanga yoga is a great choice since daily practice is encouraged, but power yoga, some hot yoga and some vinyasa yoga may also do the trick. another option is to use yoga as part of your overall weight loss plan but not count on getting the bulk of your cardio at yoga class. yoga combined with walking, running, or biking is a great choice.

it's all fascinating stuff. there were no ideas in this book which i didn't already know about but i loved reading about the evidence, research and experimentation which back them up. some bits made me say wow, or laugh out loud. in mammals, there are two nerves running from the brain to the larynx. one goes straight there, the other goes down to the heart, loops around the aorta and back up again. in a giraffe, that's a bloody big detour. it's like that because of the way mammals have evolved from fish, and how each part of the body has evolved from some earlier organ. in sharks, the equivalent nerves don't have a detour. oh you know what, i'm explaining this really badly - best to read the book yourself. but the point dawkins is making with this chapter is that a so-called 'intelligent designer' would not have designed mammalian bodies like this. a designer would have gone back to the drawing board and routed the nerve sensibly. but evolution can't do that. it has to make do with tiny, step by step changes, and each change has to be an improvement on the last. so the nerve can't evolve a new route because the intermediate steps would be worse than before, not better. once it finds itself looped around the aorta it just has to keep stretching as the giraffe's neck lengthens.
the solution to internationalism is nationalism. nationalism is not hatred of others but love of one's own. the prerequisite of a national rebirth is full national economic control of everything produced in the country. this does not mean state control, which is but a stepping stone to internationalisation, but absolute popular control, with private ownership of everything backed by a legal system which ensures that no trans-nationals can own (or profit by control of) anything in the country. holding on to ideological definitions created to divide us, is not an option. we need to call for full nationalisation (aka national distributism) now - and understand what that term really means.

- watching both of our favourite teams (barcelona football club and the vancouver canucks) go down in flames this week. i went with rob and the kids for the first time to watch the football match between barca and madrid at the bar this week, and what a disappointment. for barcelona to lose the game is bad enough but for real madrid to seal the deal to be the liga champions this year is very tough for the catalan with the history between the two cities. and again last night, for barca to not be able to supercede chelsea in the champions league means that they wonôt win any big trophy this year. rob and marko went to watch it at the bar with a few of the other school dads (marko is just one of the grown-ups when it comes to soccer). and again, they came home disappointed.
my plan now is to make it again, i will have to buy more fabric, but this time i will measure the pattern pieces many times, and attempt an fba (which makes no sense as itôs gathered under the bust, maybe will extend the side seam). as i put the zip at the side not the back, will cut the back as one piece, but without a big chunk in the middle¶

the road up to the pass gradually sunk into the surrounding rock. the road was carved or blasted out of this very strange looking porous black and red rock. the rock had scant vegetation growing on the sides i could see. the road went deeper into the rock where it rose up to five feet in height on either side of my car as i traveled down this new highway. my field of view was limited to what i could see upwards at an angle while sitting low in the car driving. to my left, as i drove up to the pass through the rock, i saw the butting head of a knobby mountain top. the mountain top was black and half of its face caved in or fell away at some time in its history. the side so caved in was sheer up and down for what looked like a thousand feet.

whether her fault or not, hillary seems to embody most of bill clinton's negatives without the benefit of his positives. this is almost insurmountable. it will be so easy for any opponent to remind potential voters of her image, and this could even happen as early as the democratic primaries. individual voters don't have to dislike her personally to believe that they'd be backing a loser to support her, and that's why hillary has an almost impossible task ahead of her in trying to land the swing voters. she may have a chance to win the democratic nomination, but she is unlectable as president unless the republicans put up a candidate so repugnant that the voters have to hold their nose and vote for her. hey...it's how she won the senate in , so it's not impossible. ultimately, though, if she is the democratic nominee the gop has to trip over their own genitalia to lose.

the ideal is once turning final and setting that initial back cyclic, it's a steady deceleration from to the hover right over the landing spot. which would mean, a more gentle collective at the end when you translate from flight to hover which would help slow down the helicopter more, which would require forward cyclic to keep from stopping, keeping a more level attitude, less required collective and power and anti-torque at the end.

he had brought heaps of those books back with him from calcutta. he would read them in solitude, and he would day dream about, about what? this was when his father became ill, and with poverty looming, his mother made the request to take up the jute mill job. what would he do? what could he do? he couldnôt tolerate his parentsô suffering. so obviously he had to take up the jute mill job. but he also knew that this was not the subject of his dreams. a centre forward of football, the district champion in high jump, the famous swimmer shankar, he would turn up as a clerk in a jute mill? putting his rice and dal in the tiffin carrier, and a paan in a little box in the coat pocket, running to the mill every morning by the siren, back for a quick lunch at noon, then wait for the siren at six for the knock off time. he just couldnôt see himself in that life. his whole being was repelled by the very idea î a race stallion ending up pulling carts!¶ it was close to the evening. sitting on the river bank, this is what shankar was thinking. he wanted to sail off to some far away land, amidst danger, like livingstone and stanley, like marco polo and robinson crusoe. that is what he had prepared himself for since childhood. of course, he had never thought that these could happen to men from other lands, not bengal. bengalis were brought up to be clerks, teachers, doctors or lawyers. for them, adventures in strange lands were just what you would read in books!

this is not a knock on the festival organizers. fest director mary doub and her stalwart crew put their hearts and souls into making everything work. and to an astonishing degree everything does work. but consider this: some , people attend the festival each year, and i believe the majority of these folks are camping on site. this means youôve got a small town that appears in the middle of a hay field, makes whoopee and vanishes, all in the span of four days. now add to this a music program that runs for fourteen hours a day on multiple stages. for many attendees, however, the formal musical program takes a backseat to the campsite jamming, which goes on òround the clock in certain quarters.

mirrors are a gateway to other dimensions and you might like to try this simple exercise that i adapted from one i originally learned from stuart wilde that worked very well for me in my attempt to understand other worlds and dimensions. stand in front of a full length mirror about five feet away,gaze at your reflection for a moment, still your mind then remember that your reflection in the mirror is in actual fact your mirror world self,as you do this visualise your reflection/mirror world self walking away backwards from you ten paces or so. when this is done slowly walk towards the mirror and gently try to push yourself through, as you do so turn around % and walk backwards through the mirror until you feel yourself entering the passageway that leads to the dimension beyond. do not look back at this point just focus on the glass in front of you as if you are looking into the room you started. walk back about paces and stop. feel around you with your senses and try to remember the sensations you get, breathe deeply and do not panic too much.

iôm always drawn to stories about overcoming physical disabilities, and taylorôs premise is one i hadnôt come across before, particularly in the young adult genre. how devastating a blow to lose the power of speech at the brink of adulthood, when ideas are bright and brimming to be expressed. while i love to read from the teenage male perspective, too often in contemporary stories the narrative voice is filled with so much cultivated bravado that it makes it difficult for me to like the protagonist. iôm sure that the clich„© of a teenage male whose main pastimes include swearing, drinking, drugs, sex, and sports is an accurate description of at least some members of the male populace, but itôs hardly representative of most. jake was a welcome change from the typical, providing a glimpse into the mind of a young man refreshingly well-adjusted and exceedingly normal. some might read this as boring, but i felt it much more honest and was immediately drawn into jakeôs struggles in the aftermath of his accident.

i choose to blog about these two fluencies together because my students are currently working on a project that demonstrates both fluencies. the project is called a digital time capsule. students are put into teams of three to four students and each team is given a specific time period. for example, team one may have drawn the time period - and team three may have drawn -. using their given time period the team must create a digital time capsule using the imovie application to illustrate the different aspects and events of the era. to help gather information before building their time capsule the students used the grapes+e graphic organizer we have used in class to organize the geographic, religious, accomplishments, political, economic, social structure, and entertainment information of their time period. as a part of their project each team has to create a social contractù the team must agree to follow so that each team member is held accountable for their part of the project. this idea i used from the project based learning demonstrated by new tech high that we visited earlier this month. once the social contracts are turned in and all grapes+e information is gathered the teams were allowed to start researching for video clips and images that would represent the information they found in completing their graphic organizer. as a part of research and gathering information at least one team member was to conduct a personal interview with a person that was living in the teamôs time period in order to gain first hand knowledge and experience of the era. the final stage of the project requires the students to build their time capsule in imovie by putting together the images, video clips, and text they have gathered.

one of the best techniques of meditation is by using candle. keep a lightened candle and continuously gaze its inner flame (the red part of the flame). try to concentrate on the flame. while you concentrate on the flame, you forget the world and for few seconds you are fully concentrated on the candle. this is called meditation. this enhances your concentration power and also gives peace to your mind. the state of total null or void is known as meditation. your mind is free from worldly chaos and worries. it is free from the bad spirits. daily practice will increase your mediation time and help to improve concentration. this would accelerate your mind activity and your will feel more energetic and happy.
now for the final day we have to write about how we balance knitting and crochet. the short answer is i donôt! i do whatever the whim takes me and what pattern i fancy doing next. at the moment that tends to be crochet as it lends itself more to the wire jewellery that i am currently doing. however, to be fair i did a comparison table:

next time you are talking with someone, how about listening to their feelings and thoughts without trying to fix all their problems? sometimes when we just listen and not place any judgment on what someone is saying, there is a deeper kind of listening happening that can create a healing vibration for who may need the help. somewhere in your compassionate silence is a solution vibration that they will find.

for now i'm bored senseless and feel very nauceous. the implantation was a breeze though - similar to an iui - except that you arrive at the office with an uncomfortably full bladder. this allows the uterus to be seen better as the catheter of babies is sonogram-guided into your body. the embryos are put inside the uterine cavity. the progesterone shots i've been taking are to cushion the lining and create a good baby house. the whole process took about minutes then mat and i were wheeled into reovery to hang out - and me lie flat on my back - for almost an hour and a half. mat suited up in scrubs and went into the or with me. i told him this might be our only chance of ever making a child and i felt it was appropriate that he at least be in the room with me. he gets weirded out easily and at the very end when my dr inserted a catheter and drained my bladder on the spot i could see mat's face turn green. it was sweet relief for me though!

now the area that ancestry.com enters into murky waters are the family trees, where information is provided/created by the general public. some of these family trees are constructed very well, and others are...(ahem)...not. the trees that are done well are fairly easy to spot. there is detail provided that is more than just "shaking leaf" hints, references to specific dates/places, and a general thoroughness. in defense of the other trees, i think people fall into that trap of "the name is the same so it must be," wishful thinking, or just not really doing the math/geography and thinking things through. this can also feed into the mentality of, "i found everything i needed on ancestry.com!" really? everything? this makes a genealogist who gets dusty/dirty in courthouse basements, or sits in repositories and views reels and reels of microfilm shudder.

i'm not sure why i thought it would be a good idea to head to a theme park on my half day but somehow i did. a group of close girlfriends (we all work together) all had yesterday afternoon off, so we decided to do something - go to king's island and ride roller coasters. now, normally i'm a roller coaster freak - the higher, faster, longer all the better for me. what i don't do is anything that spins or swings - makes me sick in a heart beat. so, we all get there giddy as schoolgirls and head in. everything is great - of the girls want to go on the new ride that swings and spins, so of us when to drop zone - where it raises you up slooooooowly to unimaginable heights, you sit there for a loooong time, and then it lets go. i have a little issue with heights, but that ride was sweet! total free fall for several seconds. nice! then we went on to another ride, which i was fine with - roller coaster. the third one is the one that jacked my ass up. you get in, get strapped down, and then the seats drop back so you're laying on your back. then they take out out backwards. omg. so not a good combination. thankfully i didn't vomit, but it was bad enough that i went on home right away. took a long, hot shower, curled up in the couch and waited for my momma to bring my son home. we both went to bed at : and i zonked out the entire night. now this morning i'm still a little dizzy. good lord, i'm getting old!

i really enjoyed having to write blogs every week because it really helped me with my variety of writing. i had to force myself to change up how i wrote each week to keep things interesting and it helped my writing experience. i also really enjoyed reading every body elseôs blogs. it really helped me broaden my writing horizons. it gave me a lot of ideas and it made me challenge myself to try different writing styles. another thing that i liked about writing these blogs was that it was a weekly assignment. i hate when i have classes where i only write a few papers for the entire semester because then i am not continually engaging in my writing experience. since this was a weekly assignment, it made me keep up with everything and, like i said, try different writing styles. finally, i really enjoyed revising these blogs, it made me reread my work weeks later, making me really understand the mistakes i have been making. itôs a great because i never go back and reread my writing after it has been over a week. revising my blogs was also fun to go back and see what i thought in the middle of seasons, where as now i know the outcome and know exactly why the writers did certain things in the middle of the season. i made many different revisions to the five blogs that i chose for my portfolio. i thought initially that i was going to have to change most of my blogs so i could incorporate more diversity within them, but when i went back to revise, it seemed that i had a good amount of variety. i changed my is this ad relevant to you?ù to more of a critique than an opinion of it. another change that i made to my blogs was more often then not, make the point, which becomes a stronger point if you do not include i thinkù in front of a statement. i changed that a lot in my blog about kenny powers because he is the funniest character on television. i revised my khloe and lamarù blog into videos of why i love them instead of just stating why, i decided to show the audience instead. in my is hot in cleveland the new golden girls?ù blog, i focused more on the comparison of the themes of the shows instead of the contrasting elements of the two television series. all in all, i think all my revisions did my blog for the better.

wages: ngdp can decrease if all other prices decrease with it, the relative prices between them will not change and apart from updating some menus nothing will have really changed. but it is incredibly hard to cut wages, look at the clustering of wage changes around zero in the below graph (via paul krugman). this means a decrease in ngdp relative to wages will throw people out of work as employers become unwilling to employ them at the prevailing nominal wage.

ever since ya became "the thing" there's this assumption that just because you've written a great young adult character in a book the book has to be characterized as young adult. not true. there are many fabulous works of fiction that have included well-written young adults, but would not be classified as young adult. one that pops into my head at the moment, or an author that pops into my head, is jodi picoult. jodi regularly includes a character arc for a young adult character and often that character arc plays as strong of a role as the adult's arc, but never (to the best of my knowledge) have her books been classified as young adult. part of that is that she doesn't have a young adult voice.

first of all i had to find a bike bay near home. there are two, the nearest is small and, it appears, always empty. the other is much bigger but is almost half way to work. still, itôs a start. then there is the business of purchasing your ride. they donôt make it easy for the casual user. there is a lot to read and agree to and buttons to press on the touch screen. it costs ‚£ to hire your bike during a single hour period and if you complete your journey in less than half an hour there is no further payment. finally, a release code is issued, valid for minutes, which needs to be punched into a pad on the bikeôs stand. fearful of failing to complete all the instructions in time, i finally yanked the bike free and ran over my own foot before discovering the saddle was stuck at the lowest level. being taller rather than shorter, i was forced to ride the bike with my knees up round my ears, as if in training for the can-can.

i am really worried that the government just don't get it. it would appear that as the riots have abated for now already the seriousness of the situation is being downgraded. david cameron talks tough about rioters going to prison while the courts bail them. he also makes it clear that the reduction in the policing budget will go ahead. kenneth clarke has announced that the government will increase the maximum curfew sentence from hours a day for months to hours a day for months. so already we can see that the focus will be on non custodial sentences.

saying dostoyevsky was talented with words is an understatement, to be sure. that said, i donôt think heôs quite right (although in googling for a quote on sarcasm to help make my point about pain, perhaps the quote i found on a quote-y website is taken out of some greater context that i have not tracked further). dostoyevsky is saying that sarcasm comes from a place of deep pain, and i think that much is on the money. but i donôt think sarcasm has to be the last refuge of decent folk. and we are all decent folk, or we each have at least a seed of decency inside of us. do we really need to hurt others so that we feel better, however subconsciously some of us may do so? if so, then sarcasm makes us the emotional equivalent of a schoolyard bully.
the quilt was on the bed in our spare room for a while and unfortunately the cat liked it and it got covered in cat hair. i knew that any attempt to wash it would probably land up in a mangled mess, so when we moved into our current house and we had our girls the quilt sat folded up and unused (and looking at the cat hair on it, the cat still liked it).

so, i visited this site to personally read and study balisacanôs previous research and published papers. i wasnôt surprised by what i discovered. based on his published works, balisacan is a hardcore statist who believes in government planning of the economy, income distribution, redistribution of wealth, and population control or management.

another common mistake of a follower is not keeping her own balance, thus dragging the leader out of his balance. a good follower is neither heavy nor too light, neither stiff nor too soft. it's strenuous to dance with a heavy woman, but if she is too light he canôt feel her. it's not pleasant to dance with a rigid woman, but if she is like spaghetti he canôt enjoy her either. a good follower is relaxed, comfortable to hold in the arms, surrendered with slight resistance, self-balanced, and remaining in control of herself. some women tend to be tense in the embrace, and they release their tension through head or hands against the leader, which causes heaviness on him. everyone has his/her own way to release tension. it is preferable to release tension through feet to the ground.

so we were very keen to squeeze in a weekend away, just the two of us, before this baby arrives. after hearing only good things about the wotif mystery deals, we decided to get brave and try one, and ended up with a night at the hilton brisbane for around $. we were assigned a deluxe king room, but upon check-in, we were upgraded to an executive king room! it was very lovely. the hilton is quite impressive, and in its grand foyer area, we couldnôt stop giggling because we felt like we were imposters who shouldnôt be somewhere so fancy! our room was also very lovely (with fancy features like a heated mirror which didnôt fog up no matter how hot you had your shower), but the best bit of all was i was with my husband, and we could just hang out, with nowhere to go and nothing to do¶ unless we wanted to of course.

so anyway, back to intentional living: i want to use my time wisely...as a working mom, a big chunk of time is teaching. i started keeping weekly goals for myself in january (thanks to this great idea), but that fizzled out. i am moving that whiteboard to the kitchen, so i can see it everyday. i hardly watch tv, but will cut out more. family meetings will be starting soon-i'll share how i decide to do it. i just want to make the most of the time with my family as i can. sometimes i find us all in different room, me blog surfing or reading, the kids in the playroom or watching tv, and joe working or listening to a podcast. that's fine-we all need a break sometimes, but i want to make sure it doesn't happen too often.

hey everyone! i have been taking a bit of a mental health break this week (off at both jobs!) but i decided to share a quick and easy craft with you today because i just can't stay away! these are cute little office style envelopes for gift cards. there is a template available at the bottom of the post, feel free to grab it and manipulate it to any size you want in your favorite image program. while i make these to wrap up gift cards, they would also be great to make a little larger and gift recipe cards to your friends any time of year. if you have a lot of gift cards you send out at the holidays, now is a perfect time to get started on a little stash to have on hand as well. when making your template, i recommend printing it out on card stock as it is easier to trace around and will last longer than printing on regular paper. also, the gift card envelopes i made are . inches x . inches final size. one of these days i will learn how to upload pdf files so you get things the right size to start, i swear! however, these envelopes are great for not only gift cards, but regular cards, thank you's and, as previously mentioned, wrapping up tasty recipe cards as well, so you will likely want to adapt it to any size you want.

the day i placed her in the home was the day my heart stopped beating, its chambers constricting in a pain unbearable. each day i visit in hopes that she breathes life back into me, just enough to last me until recognition shows itself again. most days i am the new neighbor in town she befriends. she inquires my name and asks if i have family. she tells me i have a handsome face and hopes that i don't think her too forward for telling me so. she tells me my face reminds her of someone, but she just can't remember who, and that it brings her comfort and she doesn't know why. each day the same conversation is had. each day tears are shed turning my puddle into a lake into a river.

i consider myself to be a fan of tom janeôs movies. most will recognize him from his roles in the mist, deep blue sea, the punisher, and dreamcatcher, all entertaining films that feature a good performance on his part. however, the role he should be known for is his portrayal of andre stander. jane is one of the few actors that can play a tough, macho role as well as very real and dramatic roles, such as stander and * (where he plays the role of mickey mantle). his accent was pretty convincing to me, but i have not heard too many south african accents except for earnie els and retief goosen so i could be wrong. he is very good at conveying the sense of uneasiness his character is feeling on the inside while trying to appear calm and intimidating on the outside. stander is a very interesting character considering the setting of the film being set in the s before all the advances in security.

i use a systematic combination of speech treatment approaches in my own oral placementù work. i generally begin with a bottom-upù method where we work on vowel sounds, then consonant-vowel words, then vowel-consonant words, etc. i also capitalize on the speech sounds a child can already make. if the child can say ah,ù ee,ù m,ù or h,ù then we can work on words or word approximations containing these sounds. i use a hands-on approach where i gently move the childôs jaw, lips, and tongue to specific locations for sounds and words (if the child allows touch). imitation is usually very difficult for children with autism, so i begin saying/facilitating speech sounds and words in unison with the child. we then work systematically from unison, to imitation, to using words in phrases and sentences. this often requires weekly speech therapy sessions with daily practice at home and several years of treatment.

kumbh vivah is just like a normal wedding. for example if a girl has a manglik dosh then she has to perform this ritual. everything would be like the real wedding. girl has to wear the wedding dress and jewelery along with a thread. parents do "kanya daan" and "phere" are also taken with the mud pot. priest has to be invited to chant the mantra's and end up everything like a real human wedding. later on the girl has to change the clothes, remove the thread and that thread is tied over the mud pot and the pot later on is drown in some river or pond without letting some one know. once the ritual is done the girl is out of manglik dosh and she can now merry to the actual person and will not be having any further issues after wedding.her husband is now safe from her mangal dosh.

these are important questions to ask, and i will get to them in a moment. first, let us notice a few things. do you see any important differences between the assertion that jesus didnôt exist,ù and the assertion that you are an inferior human being,ù which is the sort of thing that hate groups like the neo-nazis and the kkk often assert? the former statement attacks an idea; the latter attacks a person. furthermore, if a person is attacked for their race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on, that is something they cannot change. beliefs can change ì and should! ì based on evaluation of evidence, but if someone despises you for who you are, thereôs nothing you can do about it.

i struggled through the process of trying to figure out what god was doing...of trying to put him in a box that made sense to me. he was gracious and merciful, but he never stopped working to get his point across. i've struggled with a heavy heart, and faced the fact that my heart had been disobedient toward my god. and my faith...my faith was weak. yesterday i changed my generic prayer that god "brings cora home soon" to the very specific "please let us get our loa this month." i have to admit it's not the bravest step of faith i've ever taken. and when i shared my prayer request with the kids during our family worship time last night, i second guessed myself. last time i did that was in when i trusted god to bring cora into our family. and when we weren't matched with cora and they still believed that god was going to answer our prayer that cora become their little sister, it broke me. even after caden came home, they still talked about "when cora comes home" and i just couldn't take it. i sounded like a broken record telling them, "we don't know what god has planned for our family, it may be something else." because i didn't know how to tell them to stop expecting that prayer to be answered. i closed off my faith walk so that my kids couldn't "see" it...but yesterday i read an article about living out our faith in front of our children that made me step out and ask for something "publicly" again. while i feared for the second time that god might not give us cora, our kids treated finding her file like it was old news. in fact, when i told the kids that daddy and i had sent a letter to china asking if we could adopt cora, eli's response was "finally." they never stopped trusting. and i wanted to shield them from disappointment if our loa doesn't come in the timeframe we're asking for. but last night we all starting praying for an april loa...for the right, god-centered reason. even so, i was still struggling with the fact that we were even asking.

there are many scary things about childhood; almost everything else is bigger than you for a start, thatôs very scary, and then youôve got strangers, parked cars (according to dave prowse), maths, impending acne, and the fact that seemingly every other week you are taken to the doctor to be jabbed with needles to guard against an endless variety of terrible diseases that are apparently constantly trying to kill you. and, as if that wasnôt enough, sometimes, people, with absolutely no thought to future consequences to the innocent children who are, indeed, our future, make the illogical decision to insert the most terrifying characters and imagery into seemingly harmless pieces of co-called childrenôs entertainment. a prime example of this is chitty chitty bang bangôs the child catcher. i mean really, who thought this was a good idea?

unfortunately, there are a lot of very biased works on islam. particularly anything written before (the publication of orientalism) tends to work from the assumption that islam is corrupted or evil. but there are some very good recent general works on islamic belief and custom. as ridiculous as it sounds, islam for dummies is actually quite good (it appeared on every intro reading list i had as an undergraduate, and i have continued that trend with my own students). it gives a brief overview of islamic history, but focuses primarily on the modern period. the very short introduction to islam written by malise ruthven is also very good, although slightly slanted to modern concerns over islamism ì itôs a short work, and he devotes a significant section of it to the nature of jihad, which i would argue is an unfair representation of the concerns of islamic theology.

the point is that the "all kids loathe anything good for them" marketing technique is complete fiction, no matter how many anecdotal corollary data points to the contrary the you manage to dredge up. kids may not always act in their own best interests, but a kid not always knowing what's good for them is a completely different animal than a kid going out of his way to assure his own self-destruction. to believe chef boyardee, children are lemming-like in their drive to achieve malnutrition. kids don't hate vegetables because they're good for them; they hate vegetables because parents do a shitty job of varying their diets, and so they think vegetables taste like bitter, fibrous pantyhose. which kale does and should not be eaten for any reason.

as i struggled with this fight against the ingrained world views within myself ì it did take a few years. yes, i loved being home but at the beginning of my marriage i still longed for something more.ù my husband, thank goodness, was adamant that i stay home and that i create my life there. but i was obsessed with the worlds thinking that there is no fulfillment within motherhood and wifehood. i even applied for cosmetology school and my essay to the school was about my unfulfilled life scrubbing floors, and doing the same routine every day. i grew up with a mother who hated being a mother. she was constantly unhappy at home, dreaming of her lost career and what could have beenôs.ù she told me about how she cried when she found out she was pregnant, and not out of happiness, but because her life was being ruined by children. we were not allowed to celebrate motherôs day ì and every action or word about motherhood was negative. i grew up thinking from a very early age that being a mommy was not something i wanted to do! if my mother was unhappy being a mom¶.then how could i be happy being one too?

as i see many of my friends and family take to wine with respect and ultimately, beverage separatism, i see that they are potentially the same advocates who should approach beer with the same excitement. beer will challenge your senses and help to peel away the notion of beer as simply a product for quick consumption. what other beverage can enhance the range of lifeôs simple pleasures from fishing with buddies to having dinner at a fine restaurant, other than a great brew?

for the first card i drew a double border with a thin black pen. i then centred a nestability die cut fancy label shape and drew around it with the same fine liner and coloured the negative spaces in black. i left the die cut shape in place as a mask and masked off the border with post-its. i stamped a penny black image from the "trims" collection in a variety of inks and added matching stickles to each as the image resembled fireforks to me and went with the celebratory feel of an engagement. i stamped a waltzingmouse sentiment in the label once i removed the mask and finished by adding some square black gems to the corners.

these are complicated, interwoven issues. as a writer, the biggest thing under our control is the product/story we put out there. everything about the words on the page are under the control of the self-published writer. you donôt have to answer to anyone. this is both boon and bane. there is the danger in being your own boss to assume, that because the product is yours, that you always know what is best for it. this isnôt true in the business world and it isnôt in books either. as with all creative works, the artist is often too close to it to see potential flaws. this is why editing, copy-editing, cover artists, and the like are so important. sometimes people with knowledge and experience in your field have expertise and a viewpoint that are better than your own. to not use or ignore them results in a poor product.

the degree, type, and consequences of international condemnation experienced by a netherlands announcing the deportation of its muslim population would depend very heavily on the extent to which other european countries were involved in similar activities at the same time. for this reason, it is difficult to even begin to make any predictions as to what the details of the broader international response might be. however, we can reasonably predict that in the absence of a europe-wide breakdown in relations between muslims and their host societies, the netherlands would very quickly become an international pariah state. international organizations such as the un and eu could well expel it; at least some other european/western countries would condemn it; the oic and member states would call for military intervention (presumably by the us!). many third-party countries without any obvious stake in the struggle would also join in the chorus of disapproval. none of these developments would necessarily prove fatal to dutch de-islamization efforts; perhaps not even all of them together could do so. however, the external attacks would be a thorn in the side of those defending the netherlands from islam.
and what about the record? it was issued on parlophone in and features some excellent covers of contemporary folk/pop selections (the flower lady, ny mining disaster , colours, etc.) and older, popular folk numbers (house of the rising sun, geordie) accompanied by the guitar playing or by string orchestra (under the direction of arthur greenslade). deena is a british folk singer in the popular style of the day (think early marianne faithful or bridget st. john). perhaps not an original approach but all well performed. deena has a great voice and is perhaps a little unemotional at times, but that's nit-picking really. overall an excellent and unjustly forgotten record.

"worn path" is about a very old black woman on her way to a clinic to get medicine for her grandson. it is told in a very simple style, almost as if it were a folk story rather than the carefully crafted work of art it is. as the woman makes her long journey she encounters obstacles (at times it almost felt like something out of the wizard of oz) from a barking dogs to a young caucasian hunter. (as background information, we do need to know that setting is one in which racism is very much still a daily factor in life and is accepted as the norm.) the hunter tries to help her, offering her a nickel but he treats the woman-old enough to be his great-grandmother with no respect as if she were a simple minded child. the woman also clearly has a diminished mental capacity brought on by her old age. the story seems so simple on the surface but it admits of many readings but just for the mere facts of the story as well as the multiple symbolic themes we can find-

next let us think from the common manôs point of view. independence was something tangible that everyone could understand and relate to. but is lok pal such a cause? it is not at all clear how exactly a lok pal bill will improve the life of the common man. even educated people have doubts about its effectiveness. and there are people who question whether corruption is the biggest evil plaguing the nation. when public anger against corruption was at its peak, any movement related to corruption seemed like an ideal rallying point. now with the passage of time and cooling of tempers, can it still be such a powerful rallying point? can people feel passionately about lok pal the way they felt about independence?

venessa ann de la rosa, was born in ft. lewis, washington and now resides in atlanta, ga. having a father in the military afforded her the opportunity to travel all over the us and abroad with her parents. as a young teen she grew up watching her father perform in the theater. she, too, caught the performing bug and began acting and modeling in high school. it was when venessa participated in the miss teen san antonio pageant that her dream of becoming a successful model grew into a passion. her unique onstage presence led to an invitation to be a presenter at the texas tejano music awards where she shared the same stage with the late singer selena. after graduating high school, venessa decided to follow her father's footsteps and entered into the us army where she served four years. after serving her term, she entered into corporate america, working for officemax and then relocating to atlanta to work for the home depot corporate. in she decided to return to the modeling industry after being inspired by the antm season that featured toccara jones. toccara's resilience and positive affirmation of plus size women inspired venessa to continue to pursue her modeling career.

escarole is a wonderful, slightly bitter green, that most people may be familiar with eating raw in salads, but which becomes meltingly tender when cooked. italians have many recipes for braised and sauteed escarole and it is a traditional ingredient in greens and beans and italian wedding soup. we love escarole so much that it is a regular part of our home garden. it's easy to grow, but it is the one vegetable that invites slugs into our usually very dry, sandy soil, garden environment. escarole grows thickly at the base, so between the slug issue and the many grains of sand that hide in its crevasses, this vegetable requires thorough rinsing and several soaks before it's ready for the cooking pot.

i have always felt that the most irresponsible movies are those that are very casual about their violence. the 's and early 's were filled with them. true lies jumps to mind, which also had the added benefit of reinforcing terrible racial stereotypes and painfully unfunny comedic scenes starring arnold schwarzenegger. pretty much all of the schwarzenegger output of the 's falls into this category. he would mow down enemies with machine-gun fire, there would be little blood, and no consequences. his characters were blanketly heroes, never plagued by any regret at having claimed larger body counts than most natural disasters. these were the films few politicians complained about...politicians hearkening back to a more innocent age in film where the cowboy in the white hat was the good guy and his killing was just. the evil guy with the black hat fell over unceremoniously at the end of the film and the hero walked off into the sunset, on to kill more evil-doers in the next town. former president george w bush reflected this kind of black and white point of view throughout his presidency. our current world is more nuanced than this. our heroes have continually been exposed as flawed human beings...that murder is murder. this is closer to reality. however, when art depicts violence in a more realistic way, politicians get upset. or more to the point, the extremist christian lobby gets upset, and the politicians adopt their stance while putting their hands into the coffers. the violence in the sopranos is shocking and horrible...as it should be. it is still less shocking and horrible than it is for those who experience it first hand.

the whole idea of wodehouse stories is not the complexity of the plot but the language and characterization. i almost felt as though i was reading poetry or a work of art rather than just a story. the scene of fink-nottle giving speech in a school was one of the best comic scenes and so was the part involving anatole, the great chef at aunt dahliaôs house. some places where bertie is trying to put down jeeves in the matter of telling him yes sirù or sirù in response to bertieôs ideas is amazingly done. if that scene were to be done on video, it would have been easy but to capture the nuance of speech in written word in not so easy. in another place, bertie and jeeves communicate just by raising their eyebrows or repeat what each other is saying. i can actually go on and on describing all the scenes in the book.

the kid mohair had marinated in my stash for quite while i remained uninspired. then i bought some nice pink jade sapphire cashmere to make a pair of mittens, and i just knew the mittens would be perfect if i knitted them using a strand of the cashmere and a strand of the mohair. nice, soft, fuzzy mittens resulted. but i still had over . balls of kid mohair stashed away. it was time to wait for more inspiration.

canada's crime rate will almost certainly continue its downward trend after the conservative party's omnibus crime bill goes into effect, and harper will claim this continued trend as a party victory. it will fall to the opposition parties to argue that such an outcome is in fact illusory: the legislation will have cost canadians billions of dollars without providing any actual improvement in quality of life or public safety. harper may as well put billions into constructing a wall meant to deter an elephant invasion, then claim it "worked" when no elephants subsequently attack canada.

what this means is that watching and recording sales is important, at least for the first week or so after the book is back in the paid store after going free. authors who don't fuss and fret and obsess about watching the kdp dashboard are doing themselves a disservice. authors who proudly admit they only check the kdp dashboard once a month, once a week or even once every couple of days aren't able to capitalize and optimize in an industry that now moves at digital speed. why do you think amazon updates rank every hour rather than just recalculating every hours? because when books are selling, it's a volatile business. sometimes you can't do anything with collected data. sometimes you can. in the case of our repricing strategy, we can.

i canôt imagine a better snippet of dialogue to catch the way these girls of dunhamôs articulate exactly the kind of emotional and intellectual chaos i see in my students of the same relative intelligence and class status. theyôve got a whipsmart quick-wittedness that serves as the lingua franca of young women î self-identifying as smart, self-deprecating, funny, astute, sometimes brutally honest. traveling in packs with the volume jacked up, these girlsô verbal patter can reach a manic level. but theyôre neither self-aware nor knowledgeable enough to know how idiotic they sound to everyone who lives outside their tribe. the patter covers up a lot of the neurotic uncertainty.
the court described the case as òyet another round in what has been described as the conflict between the electronic equipment industry and the entertainment industryô, in which the actions of an entity that òfacilitatesô copying, rather than the consumer who is the beneficiary of it, are called into question. the role and responsibilities of intermediaries who develop businesses based on content produced by others is a key feature of the current debates about copyright policy. interestingly, melbourne barrister warwick rothnie in his blog ipwars.com, has queried whether there might be implications from this decision for the liability of internet service providers for the actions of their subscribers.

oh, they eat crawdads here as a tradition when they're on boats in the summer. it's sort of cool: a crawdad broil on a riverboat with beers, wine, and champagne in a relatively bucolic landscape. we staged the party and the whole boat smelled like delicious crawdads and i had none. i ate sand. you ate what? i ate sand and pulled focus and was generally cramped and slightly annoyed until we got off the boat. not a bad day of work but could have been easier if everyone else would have gotten the fuck out of the way. so it goes.

the negative impact of copycat behaviour brought about by close human connectedness can be, on the other hand, often fatal: alcoholism, the aforementioned smoking problems and drugs addiction. it usually starts innocently enough and in such a subtle way that before you know it you're in it up to your chest. a spliff is passed around. a drink is shared. a needle is produced. we, humans, are certainly interesting, and so are the networks we beget.

the prodding and emotive phrases listed above are, however, merely word shifts, synonyms for instinctive or inherent or intrinsic or intuitive. said another way these self-righteous people are demonstrating (perhaps without recognising it) that their behaviour is not governed by reason, but is a fixed, instinctive response. since there is no rationale, the behaviour of the sententious cannot take account of context or probable outcomes. because it is narrowly blinkered with much room for unintended consequences, such rigid self-assurance is therefore highly dangerous.

itôs sometimes difficult to appreciate events in history unless you were there. we know the stories handed down to us from tradition, or the media, or a textbook, but the distance tends to numb us to the situation, especially when our world is built on the results of those events. this can be seen in something like the declaration of independence. for americans, who have grown up in the land of the free, we may know about the american revolution, because we grew up here. we grew up without the monarchy, in a system of government that was formed at the time of the revolution and has for us been the way itôs always beenù. for those who lived during the revolution, it must have been very different, a big leap of faith, conflict between those who were still loyal to england and those who wanted independence, setting up a constitution for a new nation, a lot of trial and error and of course a big war to fight to gain it all.

someone from our church had stopped me on my way out the door. i was only about years old and she was waiting in the car for me. my dad had pulled the car around to the front of the church so she didnôt have to walk far (he catered to her every whim his entire life) and had gotten out for some reason. one of the ladies at church, mrs. anderson stopped me and told me i had the most beautiful curly hair she had ever seen. i was over the moon! i remember skipping to the car because i thought it would make my hair bounce a little bit more and i imagined mrs. anderson watching me and being green with envy. iôm sure that didnôt happen, but in my year old psyche, it was a picture i wanted to hold onto. i piled in the car so fast, i wasnôt accustomed to such compliments and i just needed to share it. when i told my mother about the compliment i had just received i felt like i was glowing all over. my mother turned around and looked at me sitting in the back seat of our car and said, mrs. anderson feels sorry for you.ù she turned back around facing the front of the car and we never said a word after that, we just waited for my dad. i remember being very quiet the whole ride home. i was studying myself, looking for that glaring problem i must have that would stir such sympathy in someone. for more than years, every time somebody complimented me on my curly hair, i thought i had a knife in my head.

it is about time to bring our southwest trip to a close. beginning in phoenix (arizona birding), we made our way to the grand canyon (who stole the grand canyon), then zion national park (shroud over zion), and finally arrived at bryce canyon national park. except for gale-force winds, we couldnôt have asked for a more beautiful day to welcome us to this geological wonderland! some fresh snow from the previous night lingered, while the clouds were working their way in an easterly direction. the biting wind-chill kept many of the tourists at bay, so those of us that braved the day were rewarded with a peaceful visit. as astounding as the hoodoos, cliffs and weathered mountainsides were, the cloud formations were amazing, and really enhanced the breathtaking landscapes. unfortunately the images posted below donôt do justice to the scenes, but if you havenôt yet visited bryce canyon, they might at least give you some encouragement to make it a destination on your bucket list. all of the images will open to a larger format if you click on them.

tertullian comments that he removed the author of the acts of paul and thecla from his position as presbyter for writing writings that wrongly go under paulôs name.ù[] serapion, bishop of antioch in ad, is recorded by eusebius as writing concerning the so-called gospel according to peter, a refutation in which serapion wrote we receive both peter and the other apostles as christ, but the writings which falsely bear their names we reject.ù[] origen rejected the doctrine of peter since it was not included among the books of the church and¶not a writing or peter nor of anyone else inspired by the spirit of god.ù[] the muratorian fragment records that there is said to be another letter in paulôs name to the laodiceans, and another to the alexandrians, [both] forged in accordance with marcionôs heresy, and many others which cannot be received into the catholic church, since it is not fitting that poison should be mixed with honeyù[] and the apocalypse of john we also receive, and that of peter, which some of our people will not have to be read in church. but the shepherd was written by hermas in the city of rome quite recently, in our own times, when his brother pius occupied the bishopôs chair in the church of the city of rome; and therefore it may be read indeed, but cannot be given out to the people in the church either among the prophets, since their number is complete, or among the apostles at the end of the times.ù[] clearly the early church had several leaders who thought very poorly of pseudepigraphal works and fought against their acceptance in the church.

in other words, how can anyone really be pro-life if they donôt also extend that argument to plants. and if they donôt extend that pro-life argument to plants, then how can they really be pro-life? and if they donôt extend that pro-life argument to plants, then they are hypocrites. and if they are hypocrites, then it gives justification for continuing to ridicule them and ignore them all the while unborn children are being killed in and out of the womb and the nyt is publishing absurd opinion pieces from radical, die-hard liberals disguised as satire. the nyt, not one liberal, thinks of an unborn child as a human being, so why would any of them ever think a being capable of processing, remembering and sharing information î a being with potentialities proper to it and inhabiting a world of its ownù would conjureù a fetus? but of course they would conjure up a plantù, in a futile attempt to be absurd and to show how absurdù the pro-life movement is, and is being, trying to protect unborn children, even though they neither believe a plant feels and reacts to its environment in the same way, or is remotely similar to, a fetus in any sense of the definition any more than they want to believe a fetus feels anything in its enclosed water-filled environment during its nine months of development and growth. because if a fetus can feel, then it can certainly feel pain as it is being ripped in, and to, pieces by an abortionist. and if a fetus can feel, and feel pain, how can it do that if it is not conscious? and if a fetus is conscious is it not alive? the nyt has, suspiciously, not yet demanded the passage of legislation that grants planthoodù status to peas and other fruits and vegetables, whatever life-bearing seeds, they think ought to be protected from being slaughtered in or out of its root, vine, stalk, etc. perhaps not everyone at the very liberal nyt is yet convinced that peas ought to be granted planthoodù status. if they need more proof to show how human-likeù peas are, perhaps they ought to employ sonograms on pea plants. but if they do, would they know not to rapeù the plant using the trans-carpelù type of ultrasound?

overall i think this is a terrific novel, gripping and thought provoking; but i'm slightly uncertain about the character of isabel. she is clearly meant to be attractive; she's certainly loved. and yet somehow there's a lack of warmth about her. however, this may be partly because the story is told in the first person; if you're writing about yourself, it's difficult to convey how others see you. or perhaps it's intentional; perhaps the point is that isabel isn't a heroine in the ordinary sense. there was nothing in anyone's character that made them survive or fail to survive the plague; it was just luck. isabel is an ordinary girl dealing as best she can with an unbearable situation.

just one more thing, because i think this has been getting lost in the shuffle: there is actual data out there about the impact pawn shops have on communities, and it reveals that pawn shops are bad for communities, for two reasons: ) they correlate strongly with increased property crime and ) they trap people who don't have access to credit in cycles of short-term debt that lead to long-term fiscal problems. are pawn shops the end of the world, or even the worst thing facing crown heights? no, of course not - but crime and debt are serious issues, and i told bob/eugene as much when i spoke to him (the data i reference is linked here as well). sure, pawn shops are legal (though the "jewelery store" may still be a zoning violation, in which case it is illegal), but legal and moral are not the same thing.

but aside from that little detail, it was a great story. brenda shares very openly about her life, both the good and the bad. from living on food stamps to becoming a multimillionaire. she shares about the accident that left her son brain damaged and a bit about his recovery. being a special needs mom myself, i would have enjoyed reading more on this, but i understand that there were many other stories to be told. through all of these unexpected twists and turns, brenda turns to god for strength and guidance. while she admits that she did many things wrong, i think it was a great and very honest story about relying on god through the hard times. overall, i was happy with it and look forward to reading her first book, first things first, which she cowrote with her husband. football fan or not, this is a good book!

the word "daphnomancy" comes from daphne, who according to greek legend was a woman apollo turned into a laurel tree. the practice of daphnomancy originates in greece, where laurel leaves from the sacred grove of apollo were burned to predict the future. this practice was continued during the roman empire. each emperor would plant a tree when they took the throne. laurel leaves were also used in ancient greece to crown winners of the olympics, and in rome to signify victory as well. interestingly enough, this sacred grove of laurel trees supposedly withered when nero died, and a long decline of emperors and empire followed.

if we can see early on that an unsympathetic character is, at the core, a good person, weôre more likely to tolerate his/her bad behavior. we may even start rooting for him/her. salander does a lot of illegal things, but she has a sense of justice that we can sympathize with. she punishes evil and cruel men. we may not agree with her methods, but we instinctively know that she wouldnôt harm an innocent.

what we're seeing now is that myth beginning to unravel. the type of rhetoric liberals have been indulging in the past ten years, the barely-controlled personal attacks and open menacing of every last individual who opposes them -- bush, rove, cheney, rice, palin, and bachmann -- serves as its own fuel. the more it's repeated, the more incendiary it grows, the more it spreads, and the more used to it people become. it's like a narcotic that you grow habituated to -- every time you hit up, you need a bigger jolt. eventually the threats become so lurid, so wild-eyed, that they begin to take on a life of their own. they become the standard means of expression. and at some definite but unknowable point, they begin to fulfill themselves. some of your comrades, the more stupid, the more unbalanced, the more fanatical, begin taking them seriously, and start acting them out.

to complete my personal dream picture, it turns out i'd moved down to los angeles myself not too many years before along with a betty/diane actress/girlfriend who had been lured by hollywood's dangerous siren call of fame and fortune. she was gone by the time the movie came out, but i don't know if she wound up crashing on the rocks like lynch's blonde heroine. if she did, it didn't make the papers. after she left though, i found myself on many a night afterward navigating the sharp corners of mulholland dr., thrilling at the old road's sloping curves while soaking in the history and the dreams and trying to forget.

the mountain climbing and rappelling scenes are reminiscent of cliffhanger (favourite stallone movie evarr) whilst the tense forest shootouts and chase scenes have a deliverance heavy feel. there's even something about the wicker man to the film's local scottish village. it's not a very original movie, but that makes it no less pretty to watch. it could have been melissa george sitting on the side of a mountain for two hours and i still would have enjoyed this. heck, i could sit and stare just at melissa george's grazed knee and be perfectly content.

the third item in the above paragraph has not been true for some time; labor has not been so weak against capital since the s, or perhaps earlier. the authors were writing just before the collapse of the soviet bloc, a zone that, despite its faults, did provide alternative ideas of social organization. the blocôs collapse pitched the left into a crisis nowhere near a solution, opened a previously blocked swath of the world for full exploitation by capital and weakened resistance to the onslaught of neoliberal triumphalism.

"hans-peter lindstr„∏m is back with what's technically only his second "proper" solo album, and it is a feisty one. the unpredictable norwegian producer seems to be taking some cues here from his labelmates (and sometime-remix cronies), the prog pranksters mungolian jet set; six cups of rebel is chock-full of the kind of bizarre, cartoonish, sci-fi lunacy and cheekily maximalist, gonzo musical odysseys they've made their stock-in-trade. in particular, the album is animated by a virtual armada of goofy, muppet-like voices -- most or all of which are lindstr„∏m's own, tweaked and twisted in ways even the knife might find extreme. it's certainly recognizable as the work of the same artist -- his sense of pacing, patient and playful in equal measure, remains as masterful as ever -- and features a unified, suite-like structure, but this is a far cry from the understated elegance and monumental minimalism of 's where you go i go too. it doesn't start out that way, however. the album opens in relative stillness and solemnity, with a single, spiraling organ figure gradually augmented by swelling, skyward organs, until the sudden rug pull of "de javu" launches into demento disco mode for the next -odd minutes. here's where the loopy vocal phantasmagoria really holds sway -- from the bluesman yowling "i can't get no release" to a curmudgeonly fellow muttering "all i want is a quiet place to live" to a chorus line of scatting space creatures demanding "what kind of magik do you do?" -- interwoven into a string of strutting mutant dance jams. the less vocally oriented second side embarks on a slippery arpeggio-thon that meanders like a prog-tinted jam session, featuring improvisatory drumming and oblique quotes from "here comes the sun." it passes through the twitchy, zapping acid-funk of the title track en route to the glittery, expansive synthesizer fantasia of "hina," which comes full circle with a swooning, celestial susurration of voices. it's the first time we feel a satisfying sense of prolonged suspension. the album is in a near-constant state of masterfully sustained harmonic and rhythmic tension. just when you thought it couldn't possibly last, that swirling organ line reappears like a devilish deus ex machina, and sends the whole thing circling around again." - amg

as cogently explained to me, for gamers, the amounts expended on virtual goods have to be compared with an alternative expenditure for other forms of entertainment. compare the $-dollars or more (choose your exact price, local currency and exchange rate) paid for a two-hour movie with the cumulative engagement of a game such as farmville, where each single outlay for a virtual item is a mere fraction of the cost of the movie. at the end of the day, there is no real difference between paying for two hours of pleasure via the celluloid screen and the untold hours tending to one's virtual farm and ensuring that you have the necessary implements to do so. both are popular forms of entertainment based on the enjoyment of a vicarious reality.

segelôs character jeff opens the film with a short monologue on his affinity for the movie signs and his own search for alignment in lifeôs seemingly random events. the hand-held shooting the directors (jay and mark duplass) use is very effective. not the entire film (headache) but enough that it evokes the feeling of a chase ì even though i wasnôt sure what we were chasing. the storyôs an all-in-one-day plot. there is a lot of action, but not the action-hero, high volume kind. later i thought a lot about how much of this filmôs effectiveness is related to the comedic aspects. it does have some great moments of sympathy-evoking humor, much to do with ed helms (the hangover,the office tv series) as segelôs older, a-hole brother. but this movie goes beyond the comedy genre of forgetting sarah marshall and i love you, man. there is a moral, and itôs not even cheesy. i found myself suspending disbelief because i wanted to believe in jeff and his quest.

the inspiring banner is done! it took the better part of three months, but i'm very happy with how it turned out. i designed the original in another color scheme for a specific project (it was more pastel in color), and i adapted it for the shop in a jewel tone palette, just in case you want a little (or some big) inspiration on your walls to remind you how fab you are :) each letter has a happy, motivational message (and i didn't even cheese out & pull duplicates on the repeat letters. both "n"s and all "i"s have their own design!).
over the years i did learn that there was help out there, but by now i had a wife and family and financial responsibilities that would preclude me from ever doing ( in my mind ) anything about my condition. i am not angry or anything like that, maybe just a little sorrowful. i've lived with this for so long now, it's just a part of my life that i have come to accept and embrace as the way my lord has allowed me to be born as.
it seems like an impossibility to change the media perception about my involvement in this case even though itôs false. they served their purpose by framing an innocent man at the beginning of the breivik saga and now they want to ignore the real truth because it conflicts with their initial lies and smears.

i was steadily ahead of pace. at one point i had over an minute lead on getting the :! i tried not to let that distract me. i didn't want to get excited and then mess it up. steady as she goes, i just kept focusing on my breathing and finding the flattest parts to run on since i could already tell my it band was hurting after the long stretch on the banked road of amazon parkway. i was in disbelief as i passed hayward field and saw how ahead of schedule i was - but fortunately i didn't get cocky. as tradition has it, my body revolted. my stomach wasn't happy. the last k was hard. i was alternating between walking and running too frequently. i debated getting sick and then continuing strong, but it just never happened (deja vous from last year)! i saw my lead slipping away from myself, but still felt confident. when i was running i was still "fast" (heh) and i'd push it until my stomach said no.

quite a few of the chickens had black marks on their combs most probably a result of a virus (a pox on their combs) or because of frostbite. if you ever look at the combs of the birds that do well in our northern winters (new hampshire reds, rhode island reds, ambers, etc) youôll see they have combs that are smaller and flatter than the more outrageous combs. a frost bitten comb is a comb that will eventually fall off. itôs not a pretty sight. apparently our hardy birds are willing to give up the bling in order to keep what little they have.

even though it is a very simple change, and may not appear to make a difference in our hectic lives, it is obvious that our kids look forward to knowing what we are eating and doing at least one night out of the week.
that's true with the kids too, of course. they are also human, with foibles and preferences and habits and their own varying capacity for daily accomplishment. living with them involves some daily adjustment of my expectations and my attitude. but i don't look at, for instance, chloe's foibles and preferences and habits and accomplishments and think, "she sucks." i don't think, "there she goes again, being imperfect." and i don't qualify "human" with "ridiculously" when i talk about her humanness. only my humanness is ridiculous in degree.

black milk and his band nat turner totally blessed stage (and the crowd) in a every impressively great way possible. sometimes hip hop bands tend to stray away from the original composition of a song, but they at times made the original sound even better when played w/live instruments. he performed tracks from his entire catalog from sound of the city to popular demand, to tronic to album of the year. his band nat turner turns head with every note and each key. each member were more than on point, doing a superb rendition of wu tangôs cream.ù they even took it to the dance and house world for a bit, causing some wild females to get wild on the dance floor, enjoying themselves. shout to jessica at co-sign.

mollôs gap was the turning point. after crossing this little pass, i got my first downhill of the day, and with it, my first real speed. soon after, i entered killarney national park. the area was crazy beautiful, with lakes and islands jutting out of the lakes. however, i was too cold and wet to really appreciate it. the ride was gorgeous, and fun in a i canôt believe iôm doing this ì itôll be a great story laterù kind of way. i felt disappointed, and somewhat ungrateful, that this was supposed to be the highlight of my bike trip but i saw most of it through my peripheral vision as i kept my head down and pedaled. i wanted to get out of the rain and cold as quickly as possible, plus pedaling made me feel warm at least.

my first submission is based on a photograph i must have taken some time back in the s. it was in a bingo hall in, i think, bridlington. i pointed the camera into the arcade and took a photograph in the hope that something interesting might emerge when i developed the film. nothing must have emerged because, as far as i can remember, i never made a print from the negative. but now, when i scan it, i see a woman who has turned away from her bingo game to see what kind of person wastes good film on such a scene. and there is something about her stance, something about her look, something about her enigmatic eyes which makes me want to take her out of her context and discover her anew. it's a silly game, i know, but it keeps me amused during the cold winter months.

to meet the theoretic challenge of a new stage of cognition, one has to have full confidence in the masses, not only as force but as reasonìthat is to say, confidence that their movement from practice as a form of theory does, indeed, signify that they can participate in the working out of a new theory. that is exactly what was lacking in the leadership in grenada as they debated so-called leadership methodsù instead of the dialectical methodology which flows from a philosophy of revolution. without that, leaders inevitably fell into the trap of hanging onto one or another state power.

the capitalists who own the means of energy production (such as offshore oil rigs, refineries, coal mines, and the like) are incapable of defending the environment and protecting humanity from the effects of environmental damage or climate change. this is because of capitalism's commitment to production for the sake of profit. in the market, need is measured not in terms of hunger, sickness or pollution, but in terms of profit. the capitalists of bp and other the oil companies have no reason whatsoever to avoid the pollution of the environment if this impedes the production of their profit. it is the job of obama and the politicians of the twin ruling class parties, the democrats and republicans, to protect the interests of the oil companies and make sure that nothing does indeed impede their production of profits.

those of my readers who remember how the wto talks at cancun in crashed and burned may have experienced deja vu when the climate talks at copenhagen in did exactly the same thing. the resemblance is not accidental. in the years leading up to the copenhagen climate talks, the us and its allies argued that it was necessary to replace the kyoto protocols of ì which mostly restricted carbon emissions from the industrial nations ì with a new set that would apply to industrializing countries as well. this was fair enough in the abstract, but the devil was in the details: in this case, the quotas that would place china, india, and other industrializing nations at a permanent disadvantage, and grandfather in the much higher per capita carbon emissions of the united states, europe and japan.
i am a wife, daughter, aunt, and friend. photographer by day....dreamer by night. my husband gets to hear all about my crazy dreams and he thinks i need to record and share them. i thought what better way to do that than to blog. i keep my journal by my bed and then attempt to make sense of them later. like any dreamer some can be remembered like it happened in real life while others make sense in our heads but is hard to put the story into human words.

iôll come right out and say itîthis is a film adaptation that surpasses the book itôs based on. as cleolinda jones points out in her casual and brilliant numbered thoughtsù, a story about a visual medium in a visual medium is just naturally going to be more effective. i mean, is there a book about books and the reading of them that has been more artistically successful as a movie adaptation?ù by removing katnissô internal dialogue (which makes her a more ambiguous and dynamic character) and pulling back to examine the entire system, itôs more politically focused. the love triangle, which i found so incredibly awkward and forced in the novel, becomes a distant third to the dystopia itself and katnissô relationship with her family, and the ambiguity that comes with the removal of katnissô internal monologue makes it engaging and, occasionally, thrillingîare katniss and peeta attracted to each other, trying to game the system, or on different points on a spectrum between the two? all of itîthe story, the love triangle, the dystopiaîis just so much more affecting here. iôm still hesitant about whether or not i want to continue the books (more on that in a bit), but i will be seeing the other movies (which, considering the box office for this past weekend, are definitely happening). this is the rare case where the movie is better than the book.

a commonality that we all share on this magical journey of soul perfection is the awareness that we are continuous students. many ancient texts make reference to manôs inner yearning to communicate directly with the gods, which many contend is the soul making itself heard and felt. a deep longing as we look into a star lit sky, our imagination drifting to wonder at what is truly out there. to some in recent times, a belief has arisen that earth has been seeded with souls fragments of beings from other galactic species, including angels, ascended masters and even dragons. mozart was a rare example of his time, a period of enlightenment, but that type of genius is now becoming commonplace. children are displaying some incredible talents, some observed personally by drunvalo melchezidec and writers for omni magazine in china. special schools were even established to train these super-psychic kidsù and their abilities were quite incredible, breaking the laws of physics as we understand them. it has been said that during times of greatest darkness on the earth, a great surge of souls are incarnated. these times of darkness they well recognize as the times of greatest spiritual education and perfection, including the karmic aspects and the chance to balance the scales. at these times, as well, when the principle of rhythm takes full effect, it has been quite effectively used as a means to keep the masses unbalanced. but inevitably, as history records the rise and fall and nations, this age will swing back like a pendulum from the dark polarity to that of the light. nasa confirms that our sun is radiating unknown particles and that there particles invadingù our solar system from a source they cannot determine which are helping to alter our dna. it would seem we are receiving a helping hand in this ascension process.
now, those of us involved in the book festival tend to become somewhat all-consumed by it. there's all that yurty atmosphere and we can sense the raw, heady smell of it at a thousand paces. for those of you who don't know, the yurt is an extraordinary structure that cannot truly be called a tent - it is more like a cross between a canvas palace and a canvas cave, with a lot of canvas in between, along with many rugs to trip over, many sofas of incredible uncomfortableness, and much free wine, food, coffee and highland park. also a strange combination of huge friendliness and the constant sound of egos being battered and massaged in equal measure. it's not a place to enter without several deep breaths and any other form of calming device that you have at hand.

the novel covers major historical events in a turbulent period, including the communist workerôs movement, trotskyôs assassination, fdrôs terms in washington, world war ii, and the house unamerican activities committee. although shepherdôs life is extraordinary by any standards, kingsolver was able to make it feel absolutely persuasive. while i usually dislike historical novels where ordinary people keep running into famous people, i completely accepted every sentence of this book.

it is easy to extend the above analysis to events. we speak of events such as my striking the golf ball and the golf ball flying through the air, but is this differentiation in fact anything other than convenient? surely it would be just as correct (though perhaps less convenient) to speak of a single process of motion which was at first exhibited by the golf club and later in the golf ball. pursuing the point even further, what is necessary about the categories of striking and flying ? it would be just as correct (though less useful) to say: 'there was an event of physical objects in motion.' we cut up the happening going on around us in non-necessary ways. we could cut up our club-ball happening into the downward motion of the object and the upward motion of the object. if we did this we would say that the downward motion of the object plus some other centripetal vector x caused the upward motion of the object. it might be of no interest that in the upward motion the object (as attended to) was first the club and then the ball.

when i look back at my publishing journey, the most crucial factor for me in transitioning from a writer to an author was maintaining my persistence and belief in the face of frustration and rejection. writing can be a solitary and disheartening profession, and the road to publication is hardly ever easy. most writers admit to writing multiple novels, facing countless rejections, and confronting numerous personal demons before ever getting published. and it doesnôt stop there. self doubt and fear of failure can be paralyzing to published authors as well. no one in her right mind would persist through it unless she truly loved the journey. in the end, it all comes down to having an unwavering passion to write.
so a parent has to earn the privilege of connecting with their children by coaching, and loving, and respecting, and believing, and inspiring, and motivating . . . but with a humility and grace that inspires confidence and trust, and earns credibility with their partner and their children. they have to recognize the fault in their expectation that a child should listen to and respect the parent because they are a parent, instead of because of what kind of parent they are. they must recognize and embody what every good leaders knows instinctively - that trust and credibility with your children must be earned, in every action and word.

the tragic conclusion to the film documents the collapse of protagonist johnny (peter breck) into a state of catatonic schizophrenia, but this outcome holds little surprise for either cathy (constance towers) or the spectator. johnnyôs psychological collapse was, from johnnyôs introductory voiceover announcing his defeat, inevitable. if not a self-fufilling prophecy as such, his final insanity was at least a self-motivated one. the distinction between sanity and insanity is tenuous from the outset ì that johnny and his colleagues so haphazardly tempt fate seems, for cathy at least, to be asking for trouble. as the films primary metaphor for division, the sane/insane binary is predicated upon johnnyôs final (and seemingly irreversible) collapse into a catatonic schizophrenic state. johnnyôs schizophreniaù (the process of division) takes different forms, where even his occupation as a journalist shifts him from an objective onlooker to a subjective centre of experience. johnnyôs decay into schizophrenia is active, loaded with high-energy visuals (such as the famous colourised waterfall sequence), and functions in stark comparison to his passive (and somewhat arrogant) resignation to his role as deceiver, the ambitious trickster who is trumped by his own game. with his collapse, johnny is at last liberated from his own fictions and self-delusions. as hero ì or at least protagonist ì of shock corridor, johnnyôs journey marks a shift from one narrative stream (sane) to another (insane).

many of the jews who had come to visit mary and witnessed this event become believers, but some of them go and tell the pharisees what they had seen. the pharisees are alarmed at word of this miracle, and call a meeting. some of the more frustrated pharisees ask why theyôre even bothering; jesus has done lots of miracles, of which raising lazarus is only the most recent, and itôs only a matter of time before everyone in all of israel believes in him. when that happens, theyôre all doomed, because rome will finally and inexorably take note of whatôs going on and crush them all. jerusalem and the temple will be destroyed, and all of israel and the jewish nation will be destroyed too, they declare with a mixture of anger and bitterness.

in the second half of the book, she started to pull it all together and talk more about health and emotions. basically, through her research she has developed a holistic body-mind outlook: emotions are in the body and not just the mind; the mind can influence the body, and the body can influence the mind (a two-way communication); all systems tie together (immune, endocrine, nervous, etc.) and communicate with each other. i think most of these ideas would not be surprising to anyone these days. the book was written over a decade ago, so it was probably a more revolutionary message back then. but it was still interesting to read about the actual science behind it. at the very end, she tied spirituality into it too, another subject that fascinates me, so the book ended up containing almost every topic i adore: science, history, personal narrative, sexism / feminism, psychology, health, and religion / spirituality.

i've learned that with growing mentally and spiritually, you have to experience some pain in order to mature. it's different from the physical pain of growing pains, but it can cut you to the core and make you feel as though your heart is breaking. i've been at both ends of the spectrum. i've felt times of such intense pain that i thought i couldn't take it anymore. (these were probably the usual situations family, friends, life decisions, etc.) i've also been so numb that i just didn't care anymore. (despite, getting a break from feeling, i can promise you feeling is so much better.) through these times, i grew as a person. it seems that whatever situation life throws at you, you can persevere. if you take the bad situation and try to learn from it. you will always make mistakes because we are all imperfect, but the important thing is to learn and allow change to take place in your life.

many speakers do not take this approach to the passage. instead, they focus on another person entirely: melchizedek. he is a very mysterious character mentioned to be a king and a priest of god. how could this be? the priesthood had not even been established yet. the mosaic law had not been given. how could he be a priest? also, how is it that melchizedek could be a follower of god and not be a part of abramôs family? abram even acknowledges melchizedekôs spiritual superiority by accepting his blessing and giving him a tithe.

arising in darkness conjures years spent on the road in sales ì cruising behind hopped up tractor trailer drivers on icy highways headed too far north ì recalls chunky salted gravel and cracked windshields, gold jewelry and high heels; competitive striving and the stale breath of poverty blowing straight down the back of my youthful neck. if i were to whitewash memories a bit, iôd cast back to a childhood spent in anticipation of oceans and lakes, deserts and mountains ì places out of the city where my young soul gulped the rarified air of freedom. but it meant arising at four, and even then it seemed a sacrilege to shuffle about before the sun decided to broadcast another day.

there are three steps to the arm movement: outsweep, insweep, and recovery. the movement starts with the outsweep. from the initial position, the hands sink a little bit down and the palms face inward, and the hands rotate outward and move apart. during the outsweep the arms stay almost straight and parallel to the surface. the outsweep is followed by the insweep, where the hands point down and push the water backwards. the elbows stay in the horizontal plane through the shoulders. the hands push back until approximately the vertical plane through the shoulders. at the end of the insweep the hands come together with facing palms in front of the chest and the elbows are at the side at the body. in the recovery phase the hands are moved forward again into the initial position under water. the entire arm stroke starts slowly, increases speed to the peak arm movement speed in the insweep phase, and slows down again during recovery. the goal is to produce maximum thrust during the insweep phase, and minimum drag during the recovery phase.

nevertheless, the truth is that both sides havenôt moved away from the center. only republicans have, and democrats have spent the past years chasing them in hopes that eventually they could reach some kind of reconciliation. but it never did any good. the democratic move rightward was interpreted not as a bid for compromise somewhere in the middle, but as a victory for a resurgent conservative movement that merely inspired them to move the goalposts even further out.

the so-called deterrent effect is one of the main arguments in favor of capital punishment. iôve argued many times before that the data we have donôt support the existence of this effect. some of the data even suggest the possibility that instead of a deterrent effect, capital punishment has a brutalization effect (because it sends out the normative message that violent retaliation is the normal response to ill-treatment and that the sanctity of life is a naive moral ideal).

train cars are wider, have plenty of legroom, you can lean back in your seat without bumping the legs of the guy behind you (and vice versa), there's food available, and they travel faster. not to get too political, but the obama administration supports high-speed rail in this country, and it's an idea whose time has long since come. more trains means fewer cars on the highways, and when you're talking high-speed, there's really no comparison when it comes to longer trips.

they undoubtedly also bent the stick somewhat polemically against bakunin who, basing himself on the revolutionary potential of the peasantry, ì a potential marx and engels showed did not exist because of the atomised nature of the peasantry (see marx ì th brumaire of louis bonaparte where his class theory is most clearly set out) -argued for the revolutionary nature of these struggles, but, it seems to me, that, in fact, rosdolsky was right in the ôs when he argued that marx and engels based themselves on historical materialism, and that he is wrong in his later appraisal. marx and engels theory of historical materialism certainly does put class at the forefront of explaining historical development. it is certainly within that context that determination of which forces are progressive can be determined. but it is economistic to think that class is the only criterion utilised by marx and engels in orienting themselves in the world they were in. it is quite obvious that nationality and nationalism were and are important cleavages and ideologies running through societies, as well as class, and, as i said at the beginning, struggles, based around nationality, can only be progressive if they are viewed in the context of historical reality, of who is leading those struggles, and by what means. indeed, nationality, as a cross cutting cleavage, is one that is usually reactionary it cuts across class lines, dividing the working class, and indeed tending to unite sections of the working class with its own bourgeoisie and petit-bourgeoisie. it is not at all surprising, to me, then, that marx and engels, especially at a time of heightened revolutionary activity, such as , but not just at that time, should conclude that some such struggles were reactionary, that those conducting them were incapable of using their own internal resources for achieving their aims, that, in order to do so, they had to ally themselves with reactionary international forces ì at that time with tsarist russia who marx and engels viewed in the same way that some marxists today view the us i.e. a force to be opposed in all circumstances, and almost to be defeated by any means.

in order to reduce the contestants down the final , each judge had to select two contestants to go up against each in other in a battle. after each battle it would be up to the judges to select the person they wanted to take through. this was the point where the show fell down. it was no longer about the voice but clearly about the age and look of the contestants. if you look at the majority of battles, nearly every time the younger contestant went through. will.i.am make the choice of a contestant based on age due to who he was as a year old. foolishness.

() deterring investors. imagine that you are investing in a foreign country, a country that you assess as stable and which upholds the rule of law and allows you to generate a return on your investment. all of a sudden that country decides to appropriate your asset and not pay you for it. how likely are you to invest in that country again? well the experience of countries where this has happened tells us that investors will come back but they will be more cautious than before. but what ireland is proposing to do is to bring its commercial leases in line with the rest of europe and ensure that a major factor of production is priced at a competitive level. even if this government yellows it on this commitment, then investors will still have somewhere in their minds that the next government, which might be more left-wing by the way, will introduce the change.

with a third of my time at school here over, iôve had ups and downs just like i would at home. as a study abroad student, orientations drill into your head the curve of emotions you will experience. immediate elation upon arriving into the new environment; coming down off of that high and feeling homesick or out of place; acclimation to the local culture. i can say that i was skeptical at first, but i know that i in fact experienced all stages of this already. almost a month into being in morocco, i was struck with a general malaise which was accentuated whenever i saw emails from home or went on facebook. i came to realize this was me, feeling homesick and having some issues with separation with the only home iôd known for years. the slump lasted about two weeks, and traveling on the weekends during that time definitely helped. now i feel much better and i am used to the day-to-day like itôs always been this way. the final stage of the emotional roller coaster is said to be reverse culture shock upon returning to oneôs home country; luckily, i have quite a while until i experience that!

this time, when his eyes met taslin's, there was no teasing, no pretended humanity. just the hard focus of desperation. she reached out a hand to him, and he grabbed it almost without thinking. the axtli boiled into the croft, black fog that brought with it a wrenching sense of nausea. then, suddenly, falling, tumbling, through where the floor should have been, and something caught him across the belly, flipping him over. dora screamed in pain, drowning out taslin's curse, and there was darkness.
here is the deepest secret no one knows.

notwithstanding the pardon, the bbc correspondent caroline wyatt was of the opinion that the womanôs fate would be little better outside prison, due to the sanctity of òfamily honourô in afghanistan. family honour is so important that it usually comes before individual liberty, freedom, and wellbeing. reflecting this fact, gulnaz even conceded that she would have married her attacker if it had meant she were able to go home to her family. however that option had not been given to her and as a result she, and her now newly born child, were living in a òwomenôsô safe houseô. the reality for gulnaz was that to return after having tarnished her familyôs honour, could have lethal consequences. sadly there are also few ways for women to survive in afghanistan without family support.

i decided to call a nearby veterinary clinic, and good thing thereôs one just twenty minutes away from where i live. while i am thinking how to bring katie to the vet, i suddenly heard her meowing as she walked from the backyard all the way to the garage. since iôve seen earlier how weak she is, i told myself that maybe, she is getting better. i also took it as a cue to bring her to the vet (i placed her in a basket). thanks to a cab driver living near our house, i was able to do that.

hi guys
interestingly, there doesnôt seem to be any relationship between this transformation and a previous interest in spirituality, or a history of spiritual practice. only a small number of the people i spoke to were following spiritual practices or traditions, or even familiar with the basic ideas of spirituality. they werenôt mystics or monks, or even spiritual seekers. they were òordinaryô people with ordinary jobs, who happened to go through intense psychological turmoil. as a result, like russell, it took them a long time to comprehend what had occurred. initially, although they felt liberated and peaceful, many of them felt slightly bemused by their new state. usually, they went through a slow process of gravitating towards spiritual books and other òawakenedô people, until they finally had a framework to make sense of their new state.

iôve always felt fairly strongly that if a place claimed to be the france of¶ù (take your pick: new zealand, hoboken, northwest wisconsin), it should at least have a few french women living there. french women just add an irresistible¶frenchness¶to a destination that can not be faked, not even by french men. and that is why iôm pleased to report that in a recent story that i wrote for portland, oregon-based mix magazine, i managed to find four frenchwomen who are making wine professionally in oregon, most of whom reside or work in the willamette valley (i.e. the burgundy of the u.s.ù). two other women who make wine in the area ì and very good wine at that ì are so elegant in their manners and bearing that everyone thinks theyôre french, which is almost as good as the real thing. i put them into the story anyway.

in short, for a pricetag of nearly times what it would have cost the county attorney to do it both legally and in-house, el paso juvenile court judge alfredo chavez convinced the school district to contract with a private company to "bluff" truancy enforcement -- a tactic that worked only until students and their parents figured out that the private "referees" had no authority to carry out their threats (which included dropping students from school rolls and even ordering youth to mexico). this multi-million dollar contract went to men now under indictment on el paso bribery charges related to a second judge on the county juvenile board. now, everyone is under investigation.

i think that most conspiracy theories are dismissed out-of-hand is because the evidence is flimsy, circumstantial and not actually in support of their theory. to most people with a good, thinking brain, it is obvious that there is nothing holding their theories up. to sum up, conspiracy theories are silly.

this is my name for the delirium tremens clone ahs recipe. i had one that hit, one that missed and i'm trying to recreate the greatness of the one that hit. things are changing a bit though. the hop shortage meant that i substituted fuggle for the styrian goldings and i used saaz sladek rather than the trschitz type. that may add a touch more bitterness. ahs was also out of extra pale extract. instead of the lbs. of liquid malt extract, i took lbs. of dry malt extract (dme). i have been using late addition for any of the lighter colored brews and i tried with this one too. i put lbs. of the dme in with the / lbs. clear candi at the start and added the last lbs. of dme after the boil. the dme is interesting to get stirred in correctly. i had lumps to work down. in the end i had a wort with an o.g. of . - much more than the . the recipe expects. i did leave this a bit more concentrated in the primary to give more head space. the previous two versions blew the lid a couple times. i set up my blow off tube expecting that the foam would spill through the tube into the bucket. not so. it did give good bits of bubbles for a couple days, but then settled down. i don't have temp. control in my brew closet, but it has been a bit on the colder side these days. i might expect that the average temp is f or f. still reminds me that my next beer project is to get another freezer for temp control on fermentation. still, checking the beer through the airlock hole, i can see that the foam still completely covers the top. i think the yeasties are still happy and working. i'll have to wait a week, maybe two, until i rack it off to a carboy. i fully expect this one to sit for - months. i'm wondering if i have to wait longer. this beer has the potential of %.

if you love a fine cup of coffee, you want to make sure you get yourself a commercial coffee maker. these are an ideal addition to your kitchen and would give you a great cup almost instantly. the gurgles, burbles and whooshing noises make the experience of making that perfect cup all the more enjoyable. not to mention the great ensnaring aroma which is enough to entice people straight of the street into your home or restaurant. many people are now buying commercial coffee makers for their homes because you can buy them at very affordable rates. no longer would you find these only in bistros and coffee shops. you can buy a wide range of these products online. they are available in a variety of styles and designs. the best part is that you will surely find some store online that is selling these at a discount. there are number of stores which sell these products at a rate that is marginally above the wholesale price.

employees would be better off with reform because it reduces stress, increases job satisfaction, allows workers to transition between jobs better and improves employee-employer relationships. as employees would not be tied to a job because of the benefits, they are less likely to stay on at a job they dislike. on average, this should translate to higher job satisfaction. furthermore, job mobility would be improved as employees do not have to worry about gaps in insurance coverage or the costs and hassles involved with switching providers. making moves easier is especially important these days as people are changing jobs much more often than they did before. reform means that when employees lose their jobs, they donôt also have the stress associated with losing health coverage for themselves and their family. employee-employer relationships would improve significantly if the most contentious issues were removed from the relationship. what more, this would hold true weather employee-employer relationships were handled individually or thru unions.

a rambutan has that crazy sort of alien fruit look. itôs spiky tentacles are actually quite soft to the touch and make it even more exotic in appearance. once red, these peel off easily with the skin which is a little woody, but pliable. you can break the skin with a knife or your fingernail and peel it back revealing a juicy translucent globe. thereôs a clear seed inside which can be avoided once you bite into it or you can cut it out.so how does it taste? i found it to be a little bit melon-like but with the texture of a ripe grape. it sort of reminds me of a lychee, but not many people have tried that either so i donôt know if that helps. it doesnôt really drip juices, but seems like it should. depending on the ripeness of the fruit, it can vary in sweetness, but iôve yet to taste one that gives an unripe sensation; however, an overripe one can seem a little bit fermented. these are fun, but maybe a little too extreme to be seen regularly in a kidôs lunchbox. they can seem expensive, but thereôs very little waste and itôs not like youôll eat dozens of them. itôs a fun treat in the world of interesting fruit.

simpson was one of the most popular and influential leaders among populist-minded western and mid-western farmers of the late th century. angered over low crop prices, crippling bank loans, and high shipping rates, farmers began to unite in self-help groups like the grange and the farmers' alliances. initially, these groups primarily provided mutual assistance to members while agitating for the regulation of railroads and grain elevators. increasingly, though, they became centers of support for more sweeping political change by uniting to help form the new nationwide third-party movement known as the populists.

a sliver of light from the partly open door to their father's study lay on the wall of the hallway. they headed toward it, sam's bow and quiver bouncing as she walked. her stomach tensed. the xenith kids would be in a whole new league. they were the best in the world. would she measure up? or would she let her father down, embarrass him in front of their mother?
this, i am beginning to see, is the wonder of poetry. it is, usually, a short collection of words that consternate us. we don't know what the poet means, and it frustrates us. but oftentimes, there is something there that grasps us, and won't let us go. we go back to the text over and over again, turning over the thoughts that are evoked by that text, and finding over time that meaning emerges, insights we simply could not access in the first or second or third readings. and sometimes, this portal becomes an entrance into a world of meaning that has laid in wait for us.
you know those times when you feel that life just couldnôt possibly be any more perfect? well in as i have recently learned, in italy that happens about once a week, and by some supernatural power it just keeps on getting better. thats not to say living in italy is perfect. but itôs all the little extra details which can make you forget about the fact that your feet are numb from walking, your roommates are stealing your toilet paper and you can only understand about % of what anyone say to you. everything here is so beautiful and completely soaked in centuries of history and culture. so even when you feel like you canôt take it anymore, or start to wonder why you made the crazy decision to come to this strange place, something amazing always manages to creep out from between the bricks and remind you why youôre here.

òfoxyô foxglove on the other hand couldnôt care less about sub-zero temperatures. this is one of two still living in the garden that i grew from seeds last winter. they survived the florida heat and are now relishing the cooler and even the colder temps. in case you havenôt tried these in your florida garden i can tell to go for it, but forget the first spring ì unless maybe if you got them in the ground early, say, in october after the weather breaks. that may give them enough time to develop into a blooming plant in the first spring, but i have a feeling that their second season will still be better. some of mine bloomed last year (what a thrill!), but it was hot by then, and they didnôt have the height or form that the seed packet represented. this young flower stalk looks exciting.

if they are as disgruntled as the rest of the nation, they must speak out now because their opinions would send a clear message to umno, that enough is enough.i pose the question because extremist malays appear to dominate the affairs of malaysia. are the moderates consumed by apathy? are they afraid of drawing attention? a few may think they are not articulate, or that their views do not matter. perhaps, the moderates are content to carry on as we have done for the past years; hence their silence.
when it comes to choosing the right cowboy boots or cowgirl boots, it pays to invest in quality. justin boots are a good example of quality western footwear that can last for years. justin boots use a cutting edge construction design that helps the feet and legs to function efficiently, relieving pressure and strain on the feet, legs, and back. these boots also use special materials that are durable, and that even help to absorb moisture and reduce odor. unlike shirts, hats, or even jeans, boots and other footwear always take a lot of abuse. by their very nature, shoes and boots can be worn out quickly since they have ongoing, constant friction and contact with roads and sidewalks. it's worth it to purchase a very high quality, rugged pair of boots that will feel great, last long, and look great. if the boots can actually help you to stay healthy, that's even better! it's not a bad idea to have a few pairs of good boots for work and play. whether you are riding the range, dancing at a honky-tonk, riding your motorcycle, or just going to work, a good pair of cowboy boots can be a great choice. it's a good idea to shop around on the internet to find a website that can bring you the best selection and prices possible. now you can find impressive websites that have the full range of western clothes, boots, hats, and accessories of the highest quality, at very reasonable prices.

the bad news: while i was there, they again found blood in my urine. i need to learn to stop peeôing in the cage. i was also so stressed that i pooped as well, which they said was runny. this is odd, because at home iôve bee pretty darned normal. when they spoke to my mom, they said they wanted to rule out kidney or bladder stones, so they did some x-rays on my belly. these came back negative. the vet said that they could not do an accurate test of my urine to see if i had a uti again because i would still have the antibiotics in my system from last time. so today mom scheduled me for a follow-up for next week. they told her how to make it so that i have a full bladder, and they explained how they go through my abdomen directly to my bladder!! that sounds like an awful big needle. they want to rule out a uti, and do an analysis of my urine to see what might be causing all these problems. going through my abdomen allows them to bypass various other bits of me that iôd rather not speak about in mixed company. suffice to say, if they can get a sterileù sample from my bladder, they can more quickly figure out whatôs going on.

these days, getting a team to continue an idea that was generated by somebody else is almost akin to getting them to wear somebody elseôs soiled pants. it seems that if something isnôt brand, shiny and new itôs inherently less creativeù. that probably explains why thereôs more emphasis on hunting out new filmic techniques and finding the latest directors to jazz up an idea rather than on good old craft skills like writing a cracking script that has sparkling dialogue and a truly memorable pay-off.

drawing on examples from her translation practice in poetry, er„≠n moure discusses translation as an operation that is not just linguistic, but social. it takes place in a social field, and is a task accomplished throughîand that bears traces ofîthe intervention of one human body: that of the translator. in translation, the thingù or meaningù that is carried acrossù from one text to another is never purely a representation of the work of the original author. the newù meaning is part of a social fabric in the target language and is not solely resident in the text itself. what is meaning, after all, if it is not ourù meaning?

the process may not be taking the route i would have preferred in getting past this fiasco and there are days i feel like it is not even doing what the hell it is supposed to do but it is: it is teaching me to fill the emptiness and the voids with me. it is removing the rotting wood and dead weight; it reminds me of my accomplishments, my strengths, and my triumphs. it is showing me my mistakes and reminding me that whatever i feel i deserve is still not enough¶when i want to settle for treetops, it pushes me towards stars¶the process shows me that while i think the limit is the sky, in actuality the sky is nowhere near the limit. the process is taking the empty vessel i was and filling it with rising levels of self-everythings. the power of the past is no match for the positive power of self and this is what the process is giving me¶a positive self-image.

(i have had the honor or helping two such mamas). i should say that i did supplement with s and s and they turned out just fine. however, s got no formula at all, and s has had no formula either. when you know better, you do better, imo. if for any reason i need milk for s, i will be checking eats on feets before even thinking about heading to the grocery store.

around , we headed to the casino for some gambling action. hubby headed to the video poker. i headed to the slots. the casino adds free plays to players cards and sends a mailer about the free plays every month, trying to entice card holders to come back to the casino. this month, i had $ in free play on my card. hubby had $ on his. i think the amounts must have to do with how often you come and how much you play. since i come at least once a year with my girlfriend, i play more money, but certainly not times more than hubby. so maybe it has to do with how long you have been coming.

i blogged a while ago about the journey never being quite what you expected, and that being the joy of writing. but it's also the curse, because you have to forge the path yourself. and if your route goes off course, then you have no-one else to blame. at the moment before you type your first word - take your first step on the path - all is possible. but once you start to move, you don't know if you are heading anywhere near the right direction until you get to your destination.
i hope you have enjoyed todayôs little adventure and take time to look at your dies from a different angle!

you can hold me to supporting my every assertion with a bible verse or you can spare yourselves the drudgery, and either take my word for it, or the more integral thing to do, see for yourself if what i have to say measures up to biblical theology. for my beliefs about the church presuppose biblical authority and derive from my understanding of the holistic teaching on the church throughout the new testament.

bill hader played the host, natch. at first, i thought that this was going to be one of those classic snl sketches that perfectly toes the line between offensive and brilliant. though it was brilliant, it wasnôt really offensive. and judging by the reaction on the internet, i wasnôt the only one who wasnôt offended. ultimately, it was amusing thanks to its actually meaningful interpretation of personalities juxtaposed with an absurd, practically meaningless intellectual endeavor. and the icing on the cake came from the peculiar idiosyncrasies of whoôs on top?òs format (ten more minutes.ù donôt rush me!ù/ùi donôt want to picture that ì pass.ù correctù/ùi want to lose it all!) a-

the other day on twitter me and a few other bloggers where discussing our most popular blog posts and it seemed that everyone had a range of different things. it really led me to thinking about what exactly makes a post popular? how much is down to content and how much is chance, date and time and where itôs linked to? i found it really interesting to hear what other bloggers most popular posts are their reaction to them and why they think that is. so vicki at cosy books and i have decided to do this post to share with you our blogs most popular posts. weôd also love to know what yours are as well if youôre a blogger so please feel free to do your own post or if you donôt have time leave a comment with what yours are. weôre also planning a discussion post about this topic so all input would be hugely appreciated!

another week, another stitch fix post! i know, i know. i thought i'd make this one a little more fun (or at least less redundant) by doing it in a vlog! i don't do many vlogs... not sure why. but i think it's because i get severely embarrassed before i even hit "record"... seriously. and i say "um" a lot and have weird mannerisms and of course talk like the world is ending in seconds and i have a whole chapter to recite. whatever. here i am in all my weird speech glory! take it or leave it! ;) (there's also some audio/video lag... sorry! it didn't have the best time when exporting from imovie... i think at a few spots it actually repeats what i say... whoops! newb!)

the only issue i had with the movie was that i felt owen wilson was miscast. i don't think he did a bad job; in fact, i think he did a very good job. the problem is that his persona and personality are not right for the part of the character (basically woody allen). he's too laid back, too funny, too cheery. woody's characters are dry, nebbish, neurotic and misanthropic. it just doesn't fit. there are elements of the character that owen wilson seems to be well suited, but overall i don't think he delivers the woody allen neurosis. but i don't blame him; again, i think he was miscast.

when drafting a biotech case it is important to think carefully about the claim scope. whilst broad claims are often appropriate, claims which are too broad can be detrimental to a case. sometimes it is a case of striking the correct balance between inventive step and sufficiency to arrive at a scope which is credible from the available data. essentially the claims as initially drafted should come across as a reasonable extrapolation from the examples and with a clear distinction over the prior art. whilst amendments are of course possible later, it is advantageous to have an initial position which is credible and potentially defensible.

i found my interest waning in brandling's story with each successive page i'm afraid but carey's portrait of a grieving lover is far more engaging. catherine medicates herself with alcohol and sedatives, stumbles into work where rather than commit fully to the restoration she trawls through her old email exchanges, lost in remembrance. she is even assigned a young assistant cum spy to keep an eye on her, an 'overenthusiastic' young student who is the counterpoint to catherine's technophobe. often hooked up to her 'frankenpod' and glued to web images of the gulf of mexico oil spill as it unfurls live, it is she who cannot bear to watch catherine mooning over her inbox and downloads all the messages to a usb stick for her to take away. catherine meanwhile becomes immersed in the notebooks, the slow reconstruction of the intricate machine, and the deconstruction of her own life to its most basic elements, so that she too becomes almost machine-like, echoing de vaucansonôs duck once again as she struggles to keep herself together near the novel's conclusion - 'ingest, i thought, digest, excrete repeat.'

what a great word! applied to a story, it describes the sweep of a complex tale, usually incorporating a quest. it seems now, like many other words before it, to have broadened and weakened its meaning in some contexts, to mean something like "really really good".
the only downside of this book is that it is written purely from the christian perspective. seeing things through others eyes can be just as informative.
the key to this whole piece i think are the two words "extreme" and "irrational". in buddhism there is "the middle way". i believe in this philosophy and try to enforce it in all areas of my life. granted, i still fail in some categories when it comes to certain things. but, moderation (or the middle way) seems to be what stands out for me most. too much of anything is a bad thing, don't you think? we have to temper everything in our lives and allow other points of view to sift in. slowly, they meet in the middle.
we won't defeat islamic extremists by countering them with christian extremists like rick santorum, who lie and are willing to undermine the military solely for the purpose of pandering to special interests from the state of pennsylvania.

myself, i've never trusted the guy -- i say this even though one of kaufman's early credits is as a writer on my beloved get a life. but i very quickly became sick -- this happened as i was first watching being john malkovich in the theaters, in fact -- of kaufman, for instance, stripping very old science fiction concepts of their sf accoutrements and riding that disguised genre into the open arms of people who think they don't like genre material and therefore don't read/watch it, and therefore marvel at the very idea that anybody, say charlie kaufman or whoever, could ever come up with stuff this original and smart, never mind that kaufman and jonze have already treated you as so thunderously stupid that you needed to be explicitly told what the film was about right before being shown what it was about. show, don't tell, but if at all possible do both very loudly. so kaufman would do this sort of thing, or he would take a genuinely good idea, an actually new approach to post-modernism, and then panic when things started getting too sincere. i'm talking about adaptation here, a film about the act of literary-to-cinematic adaptation, and about what's lost and what's compromised, and about writer's block, and about charlie kaufman, and about commercialism and art, and reality, all that. but more than anything, adaptation is a film about becoming a joke, and making everything that had come before the joke a joke, too, and it's about people deciding proudly that the only way to not like the joke is to not get the joke, and come on, you like jokes, don't you? quentin tarantino said of adaptation something to the effect of (paraphrased) "never before have i been so invested in a movie only to be completely thrown out of it by the end." i know how he feels.
