# NLP-Next-Word-Prediction-SBO-Stupid Back-Off Smothing


## Introduction

Next word prediction app generates four predicted next words based on the text you input. The prediction algorithm relies on word frequencies in the English twitter, blogs, and news datasets  provided by Swiftkey.

The word prediction algorithm used in my Next Word Prediction app is a simplified version of Katz's Back-Off algorithm, referred to as Stupid Back-Off (SBO).
